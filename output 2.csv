Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon was among hundreds of people reportedly injured by what Hezbollah called “mysterious” blasts which happened simultaneously in southern Beirut and several other areas of Lebanon on Tuesday afternoon. CCTV footage appeared to show an explosion in a man’s trouser pocket as he stood at a shop till. Hezbollah said it was investigating the cause of the blasts and did not directly accuse Israel of being behind them. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been exchanging fire with Hezbollah since last October in parallel with the Gaza war. But the events come hours after Israel’s security cabinet made the safe return of 60,000 residents displaced in the north by Hezbollah attacks an official war goal. ""The security cabinet has updated the objectives of the war to include the following: Returning the residents of the north securely to their homes,"" the prime minister's office said. ""Israel will continue to act to implement this objective.” On Monday, Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant said the only way to return Israel's northern residents was through ""military action"", during a meeting with US envoy Amos Hochstein. “The possibility for an agreement is running out as Hezbollah continues to ‘tie itself’ to Hamas, and refuses to end the conflict,” a statement from his office said. Israel has repeatedly warned it could launch a military operation to drive Hezbollah away from the border. There have been almost daily exchanges of fire across the frontier since the day after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza on 7 October. Hezbollah has said it is acting in support of the Palestinian group. Both are backed by Iran and proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries. Since October, at least 589 people have been killed - the vast majority of them Hezbollah fighters - according to Lebanon's health ministry. On the Israeli side, 25 civilians and 21 members of security forces have been killed, the Israeli government says.

"'I am a rapist', admits husband Dominique Pelicot in French mass rape trial - BBC News BBC Homepage Skip to content Accessibility Help Your account Notifications Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds Bitesize More menu More menu Search BBC Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds Bitesize CBBC CBeebies Food Close menu BBC News Menu Home InDepth Israel-Gaza war US election Cost of Living War in Ukraine Climate UK World Business More Politics Culture Tech Science Health Family & Education In Pictures Newsbeat BBC Verify Disability World Africa Asia Australia Europe Latin America Middle East US & Canada 'I am a rapist', admits husband in French mass rape trial Image source, EPA Image caption, Gisèle Pelicot and her lawyers arrive at the criminal court in Avignon on Tuesday Laura Gozzi BBC News Published 17 September 2024, 09:19 BST Updated 2 hours ago Warning: This story contains distressing details from the start. Dominique Pelicot, the 71-year-old man accused of drugging his wife to sleep and recruiting dozens of men to abuse her for over 10 years, has admitted to all the charges against him in his first testimony since the trial opened on 2 September. Referring to the 50 co-defendants who are accused of raping his now ex-wife Gisèle, Mr Pelicot said: ""I am a rapist like the others in this room."" ""They all knew, they cannot say the contrary,"" he said. Only 15 of the 50 defendants admit rape, with most saying they only took part in sexual acts. Of his ex-wife, Mr Pelicot said: ""She did not deserve this."" ""I was very happy with her,"" he told the court. Gisèle, who was given the chance to respond shortly after, said: ""It is difficult for me to listen to this. For 50 years, I lived with a man who I would've never imagined could be capable of this. I trusted him completely."" Although no cameras are allowed in court, the trial is open to the public at the request of Gisèle Pelicot, who waived her right to anonymity at the beginning of the proceedings. Her legal team said opening up the trial would shift the ""shame"" back on to the accused. As she stepped out of the courtroom during a pause in the hearing on Tuesday, Gisèle was met by applause from onlookers, and she smiled as she accepted a bouquet of flowers. Since the trial began, Gisèle has become a symbol of resilience and courage. Last weekend, thousands of people gathered in cities across France to show their support to her and other victims of rape, and the trial has ignited a national conversation on marital rape, consent and chemical submission . Mr Pelicot, who is a father and grandfather, began his testimony by telling the court of traumatic childhood experiences and said he was abused by a male nurse when he was nine years old. When asked about his marriage to Gisèle, Mr Pelicot said he considered suicide when he found out she was having an affair. Throughout his testimony on Tuesday morning, Mr Pelicot repeatedly assured the court that he never ""hated"" his wife and was in fact ""crazy about [her]... I loved her immensely and I still do."" ""I loved her well for 40 years and badly for 10,"" he added, apparently referring to the decade during which he drugged her and abused her. Mr Pelicot was then questioned by Stéphane Babonneau, one of Gisèle's lawyers, who asked him why he had been unable to find the will to stop abusing her, even when she started presenting medical problems. Image source, Handout Image caption, An undated mugshot of Dominique Pelicot In previous sessions of the trial, Gisèle said she had been worried she was developing Alzheimer’s or a brain tumour because of hair and weight loss and large memory gaps. These were, in fact, side-effects of the drugs her husband was giving her. ""I tried to stop, but my addiction was stronger, the need was growing,"" he said. ""I was trying to reassure her, I betrayed her trust. I should've stopped sooner, in fact I should've never started at all."" Mr Pelicot is also accused of drugging and abusing his daughter, Caroline, after semi-naked photos of her were found on his laptop. He has previously denied this and on Tuesday he also stated he had never touched his grandchildren. ""I can look my family in the eyes and tell them that nothing else occurred,"" he said. Mr Pelicot also said he ""became perverted"" when, in 2010, he met a male nurse on the internet who suggested he drug his wife with a sedative, explained how to administer it and shared photos of drugged women. ""That's when it all clicked,"" Mr Pelicot said. ""Everything started then."" In one section of Tuesday's hearing, Mr Pelicot was also asked about the thousands of videos he filmed of men abusing his unconscious wife. These were found by investigators and were instrumental in tracking down the 50 men who are now accused of rape. Mr Pelicot recognised he had filmed the men partly for ""pleasure,"" but also ""as insurance"". Throughout the morning, Mr Pelicot appeared determined to rebut one of the main lines of defence of several of the accused, which hinges on the premise they did not “know” they were raping Gisèle - in other words, that they thought they were having consensual intercourse with her. Mr Pelicot met the defendants on a chat room called ""Without her knowledge"" on a now-closed website which hosted pornographic material. ""I didn't force anyone, they came to look for me,"" he said on Tuesday. ""They asked me if they could come, and I said yes. I never handcuffed and dragged anyone."" Some have said they were ""manipulated"" by Mr Pelicot into believing they were taking part in an erotic game in which Gisèle was only pretending to be asleep because she was shy, and several denied they knew they were being filmed. But Mr Pelicot said the only person he ever ""manipulated"" was his wife, and also said that the men must have known they were being filmed: ""There was a tripod and a screen attached to it, everyone could see it as soon as they walked into the room."" Mr Pelicot said he wanted to prove that his wife ""was a victim and not an accomplice. To prove that everything happened without her knowledge. I'm aware many [defendants] have disputed this."" Béatrice Zavarro, Mr Pelicot's lawyer, told French TV that she did not know what people would think of her client, but that he was ""sharing his truth"". She added that Mr Pelicot was ""very downtrodden"" and that although she did not know what his wife would make of his request for forgiveness, ""the confession is now under way and he will continue."" She said: ""We will get to the end of this trial and we will know everything about Dominique Pelicot."" Mr Pelicot, who was diagnosed with a kidney infection and kidney stones, was absent from court for nearly a week because of illness. He is set to give his testimony throughout the day, although he will be allowed frequent breaks.

"Leicester garment worker: 'Working for £3 an hour made me feel dirty' - BBC News BBC Homepage Skip to content Accessibility Help Your account Notifications Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds Bitesize More menu More menu Search BBC Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds Bitesize CBBC CBeebies Food Close menu BBC News Menu Home InDepth Israel-Gaza war US election Cost of Living War in Ukraine Climate UK World Business More Politics Culture Tech Science Health Family & Education In Pictures Newsbeat BBC Verify Disability England Local News Leicester 'Working for £3 an hour made me feel dirty' Image caption, Paramjit Kaur says she agreed to work for as little as £3 an hour because she was desperate Jeremy Ball BBC News, East Midlands Reporting from Leicester Khush Sameja BBC News, Leicester Published 17 September 2024, 01:42 BST Open your wardrobe, and there's a good chance you'll find garments made in Leicester. The city was once the engine of England's clothing industry, with companies including retail giant Next keeping tens of thousands of people in work. Then, after many years of factory closures, a profitable new industry arose – fast fashion . Sub-contractors supplying companies such as Boohoo offered the flexibility to deliver large orders to tight deadlines, piling the stock high and selling it cheap. But then the coronavirus pandemic lifted the lid on how intense competition had created widespread exploitation in Leicester's supply chain. Now the city is fighting to save its garment manufacturing industry once again. Paramjit Kaur, 61, worked as a sewing machine operator at several Leicester companies after moving from India to join her husband Harvinder Singh. By the time she arrived in 2015, there was already growing concern about garment factories paying well below the living wage. Paramjit says she could not speak English and struggled to find work, so she spent years working in factories that paid her between £3 and £5 an hour. She says some employers covered their tracks by creating a paper trail, which appeared to show she earned the National Living Wage. 'We were desperate' Speaking in a mixture of Hindi and Punjabi, Paramjit described how one company asked her to work for a £5 hourly rate, adding others did not give her holiday or sick pay. ""They would show 'full pay' on the payslip but once the money was in my bank, I was told to return it,"" she said. ""I used to give it back in cash. Three or four factories used to do this."" When asked why she returned the money, Paramjit said: ""It felt dirty and bad but I needed to work. No-one was paying more. ""We were desperate. We had to pay council tax, the gas bill, rent. The bills kept coming. ""It felt horrible. 'Keep working, keep working', is what they would say."" Image caption, Paramjit says she returned part of her earnings in cash Paramjit is one of several workers from India who told the BBC they earned £5 an hour or less in different clothing factories in Leicester. That is well below the National Living Wage , external , which now stands at £11.44 an hour for adults over 21. A woman in her 50s, who asked not to be identified for fear of repercussions, told the BBC she was paid £4 an hour to work as a ""packer"" in various garment factories. ""I thought it was reasonable and it was the going rate,"" she said. ""It was what most people were getting. I was desperate to work and save because I have to support my parents, my sister and nieces back in India."" The workers have been supported by the Fashion-workers Advice Bureau Leicester (FAB-L), which is funded by retail brands. These brands insist that factories making their clothes allow FAB-L to go into their sites and support workers. Image caption, Tarek Islam says 60 workers at one factory weren't paid for several months Tarek Islam, from FAB-L, says the group helps exploited garment workers who often struggle because of poor English language skills. Tarek says Leicester's garment workers sometimes accept such low wages because they are afraid of losing Universal Credit if they do not take action to get paid work , external . Employers also convince workers they are doing them ""a favour"" by giving them the experience to find minimum wage jobs, Tarek adds. Tarek says some firms demand unpaid hours, or cash refunds, so their audits record the payment of ""full wages"". ""They [employers] may make a payslip for 18 hours, so on the system people are getting paid for 18 hours, but they'll make them work for 36 hours,"" Tarek says. ""So when you check the paperwork, everything seems fine. Another thing they'll do is say, 'I'll pay the full wages in your account, so on paper we can pass all the audits, however we agreed only £5 to £6 an hour, so that extra money you need to give back to me'."" Tarek says exploitation in the industry has been the ""absolute norm"". However, he adds: ""Because the brands have increased their auditing process, and become tighter, the workers we've spoken to mostly say they're being paid the minimum wage."" Image caption, Exploitation in the industry has been described as the ""absolute norm"" Tarek says FAB-L has helped 90 garment workers recover a total of £180,000 of unpaid wages since its launch in early 2022. But he believes that is the tip of the iceberg. Tarek says one woman burst into tears as she explained how she was owed £5,000 - and too afraid to tell her husband in case he accused her of spending it. Tarek discovered that her factory had not paid 60 workers for three months. It then emerged that factory was also waiting for late payments, and FAB-L helped everyone recover their money. Tarek says he has previously persuaded garment businesses to pay up by offering to ""mediate"" complaints with the fashion brands they supply. ""As soon as I say, 'do you want me to raise it with the brand?' They'll say 'maybe we can resolve it between ourselves',"" he said. FAB-L has been funded by eight brands - including Asos, River Island and Next - and two trade unions. The group was set up in response to damning headlines about exploitation in Leicester's clothing supply chain during the pandemic. Image source, Boohoo Image caption, A damning report about factories supplying Boohoo was published in 2020 The tipping point came after barrister Alison Levitt published a scathing report about factories supplying the online fashion retailer, Boohoo. Tarek says UK fashion brands are now ""trying to be reputable"", and now most garment workers still employed in Leicester say they are receiving the National Living Wage. But many workers have lost their jobs as some suppliers shifted contracts overseas. Several estimates seen by the BBC suggest the vast majority of Leicester's garment factories have closed since the crackdown began. The Apparel and Textile Manufacturers Federation believes about 700 were operating five years ago, compared to only 60 to 100 now. Image caption, Saeed Khilji chairs the Textile Manufacturer Association of Leicestershire Saeed Khilji, from the Textile Manufacturer Association of Leicestershire, believes the scandal in the city did ""huge damage"" to legitimate clothing businesses that were already struggling to make a profit. He says that persuaded many retailers to avoid production in Leicester. The pandemic also drove a rise in online shopping. Another manufacturer, Alkesh Kapadia, believes that was an even more serious blow to Leicester's business model. He says the previous model relied on retailers ordering large quantities of each design to fill their stores across the country, whereas online brands need much smaller quantities of each design. Image source, Alkesh Kapadia Image caption, Alkesh Kapadia's factory, pictured producing garments in Leicester before he moved production overseas Alkesh used to export clothes from his Leicester factories as far afield as the US, Canada and India. But he says he has lost £2.5m the past 12 to 18 months because retailers have demanded ever-lower prices at a time when costs have risen. Image caption, Alkesh has moved production to Morocco, Turkey and Tunisia Now his company has moved production to factories in Morocco, Turkey and Tunisia, where manufacturing is cheaper. ""Fashion was my passion,"" he says. ""My surname is Kapadia. Kapadia means fabric. ""For 200 years we used to make fabrics. My father up there would be really upset that I have stopped this business."" Image caption, Saeed's factory in Nottingham Road never reopened after the pandemic Meanwhile, Saaed used six Leicester factories to make his garments, but now he says he only runs an import-export business because the UK is impossible to afford. ""As a factory owner, we not only pay the minimum wage,"" he says. ""There's also national insurance, rent, the electricity bill. Nothing has gone down."" The catalyst for change was two-fold, he says. ""Mainly the price issue. Living costs were rising, but retailers didn't want to pay the price, and secondly, we had sweatshops in Leicester, [but] 95% of factories were good but struggling, because we got this bad name because of this 5%,"" Saeed adds. Image caption, Saeed's factory has been empty for years Saeed's factory, in Nottingham Road, never reopened after orders were cancelled during Covid. ""All orders we had stopped,"" he says. ""All fabrics we had, we can't use it. Retailers cancelled orders because they can't sell. When they cancelled, they didn't pay us."" He says that has left him with stock that he cannot sell and will donate to charity. Saeed says he ""cannot see any future"" for garment production in Leicester, and Alkesh agrees. ""We are thinking that Leicester will die if you don't do anything now. Even if you do something now, it's very hard to save this industry,"" Alkesh says. Alkesh and Saeed are still based in Leicester, but both have set up their own online retail brands to sell imported clothes to customers directly. Image caption, Saeed says his stock will now be donated to charity However, the non-profit organisation Labour Behind the Label is now campaigning for fashion brands to support the city's ailing manufacturing industry. It wants brands to commit to ordering at least 1% of their products from Leicester's factories. Tarek, from FAB-L, says brands also need to consider more serious exploitation overseas. ""Imagine what exploitation is happening there,"" he says. ""Child labour. Trade unions being killed in factories. ""A brand producing in the UK, even with exploitation in their chain, is better than a brand that is producing out of the UK."" Prof Rachel Granger, from the city's De Montfort University, is an industry expert. She believes Leicester's garment industry will only survive if there is significant investment in new robot technology and a focus on quality. ""Germany had the same problem a decade earlier and invested in robots,"" she says. ""There just are not the resources to invest, that is the crux of the problem.""

Media caption, Sri Lanka crisis: Protesters swim in president's pool Ayeshea Perera and BBC Sinhala Service BBC News Published 16 September 2024 Exuberant young men splashing around in a pool with one theatrically soaping himself as a crowd cheered. Sri Lankans dancing in an opulent hallway as the iconic papare bands played festive tunes with trumpets and drums. These scenes beamed across the world on 13 July 2022 in the hours after crowds overran the presidential palace, forcing then-leader Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country. It was a moment of triumph for them. Hundreds of thousands of people from across Sri Lanka had defied a national curfew - they braved tear gas shells and water cannons to march peacefully to the presidential palace, calling on Rajapaksa to step down. For weeks, he had resisted calls to resign, even though his elder brother Mahinda Rajapaksa had already quit as prime minister to try to defuse public fury. Months of protests - called the ""aragalaya"" (struggle) in Sinhala - had culminated in the events of July 2022, leading to Mr Rajapaksa’s humiliating, hurried exit. Just a few months earlier, such events would have been unthinkable. Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Sri Lanka's foreign reserves fell to $20m in 2022, triggering an economic crisis For years, the Rajapaksa family – led by Mahinda - held a vice-like grip over Sri Lankan politics. In his first term, Mahinda Rajapaksa presided over the bloody end to Sri Lanka's civil war against Tamil Tiger rebels . That victory helped him establish himself as a national “saviour"" among the island's majority Sinhalese - his most ardent supporters compared him to an emperor. As he grew more powerful, so did his family. He appointed his younger brother, Gotabaya, as defence secretary - a position he wielded ruthlessly, critics say. Two other brothers - Basil and Chamal - rose to the jobs of finance minister and parliamentary speaker respectively. The family appealed to a majority-Sinhalese nationalist base. So, for years, they survived allegations of corruption, economic misrule, widespread human rights abuses and suppression of dissent. That changed in 2022, when a slew of policies set off the country's worst-ever economic crisis. Seventeen years after Mahinda first became president, Sri Lankan crowds celebrated the Rajapaksas' fall, certain the family was finished . But was it? Cut to two years later, and Mahinda Rajapaksa’s son, Namal, has thrown his hat into the ring for the presidential election to be held on 21 September. “It is bad enough that the people who were driven out after the aragalaya [mass protests] are contesting these polls,"" Lakshan Sandaruwan, a university student who took part in the demonstrations, told BBC Sinhala. ""What is even worse is that some may actually vote for a member of that family.” Namal is not the only Rajapaksa who is back on the scene. Gotabaya Rajapaksa himself – the man angry protesters chased out of the country - did not stay away for long. He returned just 50 days after his inglorious departure, first to Singapore and then Thailand. On his return, he was given the privileges of a former president: a plush bungalow and security, all of it paid for by the government. Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Protests calling on the Rajapaksas to resign carried on for months Ranil Wickremesinghe, an opposition politician, was appointed as president for the remaining two years of Rajapaksa’s tenure. The family-led Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna Party (SLPP), which has a two-thirds majority in parliament, threw their support behind him. Before his unexpected elevation , Wickremesinghe, a six-time former prime minister, was the only MP from his United National Party after their abysmal showing in the 2020 parliamentary elections. He has focused on rebuilding the economy. But he has been accused of protecting the Rajapaksa family, allowing them to regroup, while shielding them from prosecution - allegations he has denied. Hours after Wickremesinghe became president, the military was deployed to clear the crowds at Galle Face in Colombo, which had been the epicentre of the protests. Dozens of soldiers swooped on the site, dismantling tents and other belongings of demonstrators. In the following months, those who had stormed the presidential palace and were seen walking out with “souvenirs” - such as bed sheets or the odd keepsake to remember a historic day - have been jailed. “Ranil protected the Rajapaksa family from the wrath of the people, ensuring the continuity of the SLPP-led parliament, cabinet and the government, and not doing anything to stop corruption, and even suppressing the progress of any investigation against the Rajapaksa family members,"" said political scientist Jayadeva Uyangoda. ""He also protected them from international pressure for holding them accountable to serious human rights violations and war-related allegations.” This has angered many Sri Lankans who are living through a cost-of-living crisis, and enduring more hardships because of reforms intended to revive a stagnant economy. Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Before his unexpected elevation, Ranil Wickremesinghe was the only MP from his party Although there are no shortages or power cuts, prices have sky-rocketed. The government has also scrapped subsidies on essentials such as electricity, and cut welfare spending. Taxes, meanwhile, have gone up as Wickremesinghe has sharply increased tax rates and widened the net to shore up public revenue. Some economists say the painful measures are necessary to restore Sri Lanka’s macro-economic stability as it attempts to restructure its international debt and stick to the terms of the bailout agreed with the International Monetary Fund. The country’s foreign reserves have risen to around $6bn from a mere $20m at the height of the crisis, and inflation is around 0.5%. But the real-world impact on millions of ordinary Sri Lankans has been devastating. A study , external from policy research organisation Lirne Asia, which surveyed 10,000 households, estimated that as many as three million people fell below the poverty line in 2023, pushing the number of poor from four million to seven million. These families are going hungry and, desperate for more money, they are pulling their children out of school. The Rajapaksas have denied any wrongdoing but in 2023, the country’s Supreme Court ruled that the family – including Gotabaya and Mahinda – was directly responsible for economic mismanagement between 2019 and 2022, which triggered the crisis. Nimesha Hansini, a university student in Colombo, told BBC Sinhala she felt the Rajapaksas were “directly responsible for the economic crisis due to the financial frauds carried out under the guise of development projects during their reign”. “But nothing has changed for them – only their political power has decreased,” she added. “I don’t have much to say about them,” says Rashmi, a farmer in the traditional Rajapaksa stronghold of Hambantota. “We are suffering because of what they have done. We voted for them before, but that will never happen again.” Image caption, Rashmi says that she will never vote for the Rajapaksas again These are the minds that Namal Rajapaksa is hoping to change - he wants to win back the base. His campaign has centred around the legacy of his father Mahinda, who is still seen as a hero by some Sri Lankans. This is despite some international calls to prosecute him for war crimes. The UN estimates that 100,000 people including 40,000 Tamil civilians were killed by Sri Lankan armed forces in the final stages of the conflict, but Mahinda Rajapaksa has never been convicted of any wrongdoing and rejects such allegations. Mahinda’s images adorn Namal’s campaign rallies and his social media posts feature illustrations showing him alongside his father when he was younger. He has even tried to highlight their resemblence to each other, growing out his moustache and wearing Mahinda’s trademark red shawl. Many of his campaign posts strike a note of defiance: “We do not fear challenges; in fact, we welcome them. That’s something I learned from my father."" Another post refers to him as “patriotic, courageous and forward-thinking”. “It seems to me that Namal Rajapaksa thinks, not incorrectly, that representing the legacy of his father will enable him to protect his father’s vote base and benefit from it,"" Prof Uyangoda said. ""It is one way to rebuild the shattered electoral bases of the SLPP.” But many voters don't appear to be buying it – and polls don't suggest Namal is a serious contender for the top job. Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Namal Rajpapaksa surrounded by his father and other party and family members One comment on a campaign post on Namal’s Instagram account was scathing: “The latest heir of the Rajapaksa family taking a shot at the presidency? Quite the family business isn’t it?” Reactions on the ground were more vitriolic. “I will never vote for Namal Rajapaksa. The years of hardship we have lived are a curse on that family,” HM Sepalika, a villager who’s been resettled in Vavuniya in the north, told BBC Sinhala. “The people of this country got together and staged this struggle because they didn’t want the Rajapaksas. But they still have so much greed and lust for power that they are trying to come back and ask people to vote for them,"" said Nishanthi Harapitiya, a shop assistant in Hambantota. Others say they cannot take Namal seriously. “Why should he ask for our vote? He is a child with no experience. Who will vote for him? Unless someone votes for him out of pity for his father, he cannot be elected president,” said Mohammed Haladeen, a trader from Kathankudy in eastern Sri Lanka. Attention is now largely focused on three candidates: opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, the leftist National People’s Party alliance's Anura Kumara Dissanayake and Wickremesinghe, who is running as an independent candidate. But Namal Rajapaksa could be playing a longer game. Recent elections have shown that families or allies of once-unpopular strongmen do make big political comebacks – such as Bongbong Marcos in the Philippines or even Prabowo Subianto of Indonesia. “He wants to remain politically relevant, protect the SLPP's voter base, and be politically active till 2029,” Prof Uyangoda said. Lakshan Sandaruwan, the university student who took part in the demonstrations, agrees. “Namal is contesting the polls to prepare the necessary background for 2029, not to become the president this time,"" he said. ""But if the people do not act intelligently, the people themselves will create a Rajapaksa president again.” Related topics Asia Sri Lanka Top stories Hezbollah says exploding pagers kill three and injure many in Lebanon Published 22 minutes ago 'I am a rapist' admits man accused of drugging and abusing wife for 10 years Published 2 hours ago Live .

"HS2 blew billions - here's how and why - BBC News BBC Homepage Skip to content Accessibility Help Your account Notifications Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds Bitesize More menu More menu Search BBC Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds Bitesize CBBC CBeebies Food Close menu BBC News Menu Home InDepth Israel-Gaza war US election Cost of Living War in Ukraine Climate UK World Business More Politics Culture Tech Science Health Family & Education In Pictures Newsbeat BBC Verify Disability InDepth HS2 blew billions - here's how and why Published 16 September 2024 Richard Bilton BBC Panorama There is no shortage of places to start when trying to make sense of what went wrong for HS2 and how for around twice the original budget we’re getting half the line that was planned. One starting place is the name itself - High Speed 2. Nobody wants a slow railway. But was it ever wise to build a super-fast one? HS2’s journey began in the 1980s. Rail experts looked across the channel at France’s new high-speed TGV network and dreamed of a similar service here. The TGV trains swishing through the French countryside at just under 200 mph were in stark contrast to the UK’s creaking rolling stock. HS2 promised gleaming new trains racing between English cities at even faster speeds. A government commissioned study in 2006 had concluded Britain needed greater rail capacity. Launching his report, Sir Rod Eddington said: “My first recommendation to Government is…to improve the capacity and the performance of the existing transport network.” He was lukewarm on speed. HS2 did bring increased capacity but, as the name demonstrates, it was clearly sold on speed. A few weeks before Gordon Brown’s Labour government left office in May 2010, they made the case for High Speed Rail to MPs. They said building a conventional rail line to address capacity issues would cost almost as much as building a high-speed line. Little did they know. Andrew Gilligan was a transport advisor to Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak and is a critic of HS2. “Unlike Spain or France or Germany, all the main cities of England are within 200 miles of all the others, apart from Newcastle,” he says. “The extra time you save simply isn't worth the enormous extra expense of building it.” But speed helped attract politicians to it with the promise of a super quick connection between London and Birmingham, with trains racing further north to Leeds and Manchester. London to Manchester would take just over an hour instead of just over two. HS2: The Railway that Blew Billions HS2 was meant to be the railway of the future, but more than a decade on the project is mired in uncertainty. Richard Bilton investigates what went wrong. Watch on BBC iPlayer But faster trains don’t only require better motors. A train that travels at 230 mph needs a very straight line and that’s where cost starts to come in. To get to Birmingham from London, it would need to go through the heart of the Chilterns, an area of outstanding national beauty. Less controversial routes like alongside the M40 motorway were ruled out. Opposition came from Tory MPs speaking on behalf of unhappy Chilterns residents. They demanded expensive tunnels and cuttings to keep the new trains out of sight. Preserving the rolling hills meant more money went on engineering. In the end, 11 tunnels were commissioned between London and Birmingham, burying the line for 32 miles of the 140 mile track. There were 50 viaducts. Philip Hammond was Conservative transport secretary from 2010 to 2011 and Chancellor from 2016 to 2019. “I think we drove much more cost into the project than people perhaps were understanding at the time,” he says. In 2011, HS2 was costed at £32 billion. By 2013, the budget had risen to just over £50 billion. From the start, questions have been raised about HS2’s use of taxpayers’ money. In 2009, the Labour government had set up HS2 Limited: a company spending public money, one whose existence was by definition dependent on the project not being dropped. Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Sending HS2 through the Chilterns sparked local opposition that resulted in parts of the line being buried using expensive tunnels and cuttings Andrew Bruce joined the company in 2015. His job was to buy all the land and property for phase one of the project. He says that in his first week he was given two sets of figures. According to Mr Bruce, one set was to be used to show the government in presentations. He says these showed HS2 was on track to purchase the land on time and on budget. He says he was also given a second set of figures which showed there was no way HS2 could buy all the land and properties needed while keeping to that budget. And he says his own work subsequently found even higher estimates for land and property costs. He says that HS2 Ltd was not being honest about the likely costs even though HS2 Ltd was being paid for by the taxpayer and spending public money. HS2 disputes this. It says these allegations have been put under intense scrutiny by the National Audit Office which found nothing untoward. Andrew Bruce doesn’t accept the conclusions that HS2 draws from the NAO findings. He believes there should be further investigation. One insight into how HS2 Ltd operated can be gleaned from the redundancy payments it gave its staff when jobs moved from London to Birmingham. The Commons Public Accounts Committee found that had HS2 followed statutory redundancy terms, 94 individuals would have received a total of £1 million. In fact, they received a total of £2.76 million, paid for by the taxpayer. “We were very, very cross about that. We felt that signalled an attitude at HS2, that it was other people's money that they were spending, and they were looking after their own,” Dame Meg Hillier MP (Labour and Co-Op), then chair of the committee, told me. At the time of the committee’s report HS2 Ltd acknowledged the payments were a “serious error”. You might have thought a megaproject costing billions would be a political priority. However, in 2017, Brexit was dominating the agenda and if an outsider had the impression that MPs were distracted when they voted through the country’s biggest infrastructure project, they’d be right. Philip Hammond told me: “I'm sorry to disappoint you, but HS2 was not the main issue of the moment. The government was teetering on the brink, trying to deal with the daily hourly pressures of the Brexit negotiation. Long-term projects were perhaps not seen as quite as immediately urgent.” By the time of the vote, many believed the likely costs would be much more than the officially budgeted £55.7 billion. An internal government document produced just before the HS2 scheme was finally approved by Parliament in 2017 suggested the final figure could increase to more than £80 billion. Lord Hammond told us it would be unrealistic for every bit of treasury modelling to go before parliament. It just so happens that on this occasion the modelling was right, and by 2019 the new figure was indeed almost £80 billion. Image source, Getty Images Image caption, When HS2 jobs moved from London to Birmingham, redundancy payments exceeded statutory requirements And what of the machinery of state’s role in all this? Did the civil service do its bit to provide the true picture of rising costs? Bernadette Kelly was the top civil servant in the Department for Transport. In October 2018 and May 2019 she appeared in front of the Public Accounts Committee. At the time, her department was aware that projected costs were rising. But in public, she stuck to the official budget figure of £55.7 billion. Meg Hillier was not happy with Kelly’s evidence: “We felt it wasn't as forthcoming, and she wasn't as forthcoming as she should have been to the Public Accounts Committee. And it, you know, came close to misleading Parliament…” Dame Bernadette Kelly says when she appeared before the committee her comments were accurate and reflected the then government’s position. Whatever the case, it’s pretty clear that the parliamentary committee whose job it is to scrutinise public spending felt it wasn’t getting a clear picture of what was going on with the country’s biggest infrastructure project at a time when it was ballooning in cost. Meg Hillier says trying to keep a hold of HS2’s budget highlighted an age-old problem with the way government handles big spending projects like HS2. “It's a dance that gets played. A sort of shadowboxing that goes on between the taxpayer, parliament and government.” The consequences of that might not always be enormous but with a project of this size and complexity, the shadowboxing can cost the taxpayer billions. HS2 has been through seven prime ministers and five general elections. Image source, Getty Images Image caption, The most recent government estimate says HS2 between London and Birmingham will cost between £45 and £54 billion It’s been a long-term national infrastructure project in a short-term and highly volatile political cycle, one where politicians needed it to deliver personally for them. David Cameron adopted HS2 because it supported his idea of a Northern Powerhouse. For Boris Johnson, HS2 was about delivering on his promise of levelling up Britain after Brexit. After his 2019 election success, the high-speed line became part of that agenda. Former journalist Andrew Gilligan was Boris Johnson’s transport advisor. “He'd scored a huge victory, on the basis of an awful lot of people who'd never voted Tory before in the north,” he says. “He was concerned that if we cancelled HS2, it would harm his chances of re-election.” Eventually political support for the original vision of HS2 crumbled. The music didn’t so much stop for the line as fade out: the leg to Leeds was winnowed away and lost finally in 2021. In 2023 then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak cut the leg between Birmingham and Manchester. All that was left was the line between Birmingham and suburban west London – for now, trains would terminate at Old Oak Common and not Euston in the centre of the capital because of a lack of cash. HS2’s problems are very close to home for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The Euston site is in his constituency. The government’s last estimate of the overall cost for the remaining Birmingham to London stretch is between £45 and £54 billion. But independent rail expert Michael Byng says it could go high as £87.8 billion. That would mean taxpayers forking out more than double the original budget for half of the line that was promised. Andy Burnham, the Labour Mayor of Greater Manchester, says it’s crucial we learn the lessons. He says even after all the money that’s been spent the north is still short of capacity and needs a new line. “The handling of HS2 should be like a morality tale in Whitehall. This was the worst example of utter waste of public money.” Last week Mr Burnham was one of those unveiling plans for a new rail line linking the West Midlands and Greater Manchester, one that its backers say can be delivered at a fraction of the cost of the scrapped northern leg of HS2. Labour’s new transport secretary Louise Haigh told me: “...the serious financial challenges we have inherited on this project have become apparent, and it's dire."" Some say, irrespective of the cost, in the end the nation will be grateful for HS2. The argument goes that infrastructure projects often overspend, the focus should be on long-term benefits. But few projects overspend on such a massive scale and deliver so much less than was promised. When it opens – in about 10 years – that much-needed rail capacity between the south and Birmingham will have increased significantly. But a journey on HS2 from Birmingham to London’s western suburbs and then into the centre of the capital will take about the same time as a train between Euston and Birmingham does now. For that stretch of railway, High Speed 2 might be better named High Capacity 2. Had that been the main aim from the start, a lot of cost and grief might have been avoided.

"ADHD: How many of us will end up being diagnosed? - BBC News BBC Homepage Skip to content Accessibility Help Your account Notifications Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds Bitesize More menu More menu Search BBC Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds Bitesize CBBC CBeebies Food Close menu BBC News Menu Home InDepth Israel-Gaza war US election Cost of Living War in Ukraine Climate UK World Business More Politics Culture Tech Science Health Family & Education In Pictures Newsbeat BBC Verify Disability InDepth How many of us will end up being diagnosed with ADHD? Published 15 September 2024 Catherine Burns Health Correspondent The number of people taking ADHD medication is at a record high – and the NHS is feeling the strain as it tries to diagnose and treat the condition. Since 2015, the number of patients in England prescribed drugs to treat ADHD has nearly trebled, and BBC research suggests that it would take eight years to assess all the adults on waiting lists. Last year, ADHD was the second-most viewed condition on the NHS website. Concern about this rising demand has prompted the NHS in England to set up a taskforce , external . So what’s going on and where will it end? Is ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) becoming more common? Are we just getting better at recognising it? Or is it being over-diagnosed? It turns out it’s not just you and I who have been taken by surprise – so have the experts. Dr Ulrich Müller-Sedgwick, the ADHD champion for the UK’s Royal College of Psychiatrists, says: “Nobody predicted that the demand would go up so massively over the last 15 years, and especially the last three years.” He’s been running adult ADHD clinics since 2007. At the time, he says, there were just a few of them. ADHD is a fairly novel condition – it’s only 16 years since the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) officially recognised it in adults. When considering whether it might keep increasing, Dr Müller-Sedgwick argues that there are two different concepts to consider: prevalence and incidence. Prevalence is the percentage of people who have ADHD – Dr Müller-Sedgwick predicts that will stay pretty steady at 3 to 4% of adults in the UK. Incidence is the number of new cases – people getting a diagnosis. That’s where we’re seeing an increase. He explains: “What has changed is the number of patients we are diagnosing. It’s almost like the more we diagnose, the more word spreads.” Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Statistics suggest children with ADHD in England might be under-treated, rather than over-medicated Prof Emily Simonoff echoes this. She is a child and adolescent psychiatrist at the King’s Maudsley Partnership for Children and Young People. She thinks about 5 to 7% of children have ADHD in the UK – and says: “It's pretty similar across the world, that’s been consistent and it hasn’t actually risen.” Prof Simonoff agrees that there’s been a “steep incline” in people coming forward for assessment since the pandemic – but says this comes after years of “long-term under-recognition"". She points to statistics on ADHD drugs. She would expect about 3 to 4% of children in the UK to need ADHD medication, but in reality, only 1 to 2% are actually using it. She thinks this shows that we are still underestimating the scale of the issue. Prof Simonoff explains: “I think that's an important starting point for when we say, ‘My goodness, why are we seeing all these children now – are we over-identifying ADHD?’ We have under-diagnosed or under-recognised ADHD in the UK for many, many years.” In other words, we can expect more people to be diagnosed with ADHD now because services are playing catch-up. The 'hump' Thea Stein is chief executive of health think tank the Nuffield Trust. She’s got her own description for the recent increase in demand: “the Hump”. She says: “Diagnosis or desire to be diagnosed has risen because of knowledge and visibility – [it’s as] simple as that.” According to Stein, the most immediate task is getting through the Hump, assessing the huge backlog of people on ADHD waiting lists. Then, in the longer-term, she thinks society will get better at spotting ADHD sooner in children. She hopes this will mean that they get better support from an early age, and take some of the pressure off adult services. She says: “I have real optimism that we will come through this period of time to a much better place as a society. What I don't have optimism about is that this is a quick fix.” ADHD might be a new concept, but people struggling to concentrate is an old problem. In 1798, Scottish doctor Sir Alexander Crichton wrote about a “disease of attention” with “an unnatural degree of mental restlessness.” He explained: “When people are affected in this manner… they say they have the fidgets.” ADHD goes beyond problems concentrating or being hyperactive, though. People with it can struggle regulating their emotions and impulses. It’s been linked to substance abuse and financial difficulties as well as higher rates of crime and even car crashes. All the experts I speak to firmly agree on one point: it is much better for someone with ADHD to be diagnosed and treated as early as possible. Dr Müller-Sedgwick says there’s a “risk of really bad outcomes”. But he lights up when he describes how diagnosis and treatment can transform lives. He says: “I have seen so many patients getting better, getting back into work or back into education. I have seen parents who were going through family court proceedings who were able to be better parents. “That's why we work in this field, it's a really rewarding part of mental health to work in.” Breakthroughs in treatment Currently, ADHD treatment revolves around medication and therapy, but there are other options on the horizon. A patch worn by children with ADHD on their foreheads during sleep – connected to a device that sends stimulating pulses into the brain – is on sale in the United States. It’s not prescribed in the UK, but academics here and in the US are working on clinical trials looking into it. Prof Katya Rubia is a professor of cognitive neuroscience at King’s College London – as she puts it, “My work over the last 30 years or so is basically imaging ADHD, understanding what is different in the brains [of people with ADHD].” More from InDepth I heard years of Grenfell testimony. Here's why the disaster could have been prevented Published 1 September Israeli settlers are seizing Palestinian land under cover of war - they hope permanently Published 27 August Riots show how the UK's far right has changed Published 21 August She explains that certain parts of ADHD brains, including the frontal lobe, are slightly smaller and also less active. Prof Rubia is trying to kickstart those areas of the brain, and is working on a study looking at the trigeminal nerve – it goes directly to the brain stem and can increase activity in the frontal lobe. She says: “This is all very new. If we find an effect, we have a new treatment.” While that is yet to be proven, she does add: “If everything goes well, it could be on the market in two years.” So, the hope is that, in the not-too-distant future, there will be more ways to treat ADHD without medication. In the meantime, though, the challenge is getting through that “hump” of people waiting to be assessed – with the belief that, over time, the increase in diagnoses should lessen.

"Starmer says he'll make tough decisions - but will he say the unsayable on trickiest issues? - BBC News BBC Homepage Skip to content Accessibility Help Your account Notifications Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds Bitesize More menu More menu Search BBC Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds Bitesize CBBC CBeebies Food Close menu BBC News Menu Home InDepth Israel-Gaza war US election Cost of Living War in Ukraine Climate UK World Business More Politics Culture Tech Science Health Family & Education In Pictures Newsbeat BBC Verify Disability InDepth Starmer wants to act tough to fix long-term problems - but is he avoiding the trickiest? Published 14 September 2024 Laura Kuenssberg Presenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg @bbclaurak The clock on the mantelpiece in the Cabinet Room ticks surprisingly loudly, marking every half-second. The moment prime ministers take their seat in the captain’s chair, time is running out. Sir Keir Starmer wants you to believe he’s brave enough - and determined enough - to stare down the country’s long-term problems. Even if it means saying what was previously unsayable. To have clean energy, more people will have to put up with pylons near their homes. To have more houses built, more of us will have to accept developments in the neighbourhood. His decision to take cash to help with fuel bills away from most pensioners fits into that category too. For years, many politicians privately thought it was daft to give wealthy pensioners extra cash for their fuel bills - but it’s Sir Keir who’s now said that out loud. He says he wants to crack down on the UK’s problems, and has a whopping majority to boot. But no government can do everything all at once. Over the years I’ve heard the same list of “unsayables” from senior officials and politicians time and time again - issues that need fixing in the UK but aren’t ever confronted. So what would insiders - both current and former - put on their list of issues that are still unsayable for this new government? When it comes to health, in almost the same breath as promising to overhaul the NHS, Sir Keir says that fixing the care of the most vulnerable and elderly - the most difficult thing - will have to wait. It was the Tories’ plan to cap social care costs, and Labour were going to stick to it. They’ve now ditched it. Many politicians accept privately that you don’t have much hope of sorting out the NHS properly if you haven’t made major moves to improve the social care system. Successive governments have dangled, then dropped reform. It’s no one party’s fault. It’s no one politician’s fault. But with an ageing population and many years of pressure on public spending the problem has only become more acute. Labour has nodded sagely at the urgency of the issue. But a fundamental overhaul is on pause for now. Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you. Another issue affecting the older generation comes up often too: the triple lock. It’s the guarantee that the state pension goes up each year by either 2.5%, inflation, or earnings growth - whichever is the highest figure. “It’s not at all good for the country, but it is good politics,” a very senior opposition politician told me, even giggling at how wrong-headed it was in their view. Labour had little political choice in the election but to commit to it too. You’ll have heard Sir Keir saying repeatedly in the last few days that the winter fuel allowance cut will be offset because the triple lock, introduced by the Tories, is still in place. You can see the political appeal to always protecting pensioners’ incomes, as one former official said, but it “bakes in rising spending with an ageing population, so, unless you suddenly get brave about tax, you have no answer.” In other words, as there are more and more pensioners, more and more people will be guaranteed a certain hike in their income from the taxpayer. Whether you think that’s right and proper or think, like many politicians, that it is asking for trouble, it comes with a hefty price tag that’s only growing. Multiple sources also mentioned the serious quandary over university fees and numbers. Millions more young people have gone to university in recent decades. For many of them, and many families, it’s been life-changing. But it’s no secret that many institutions are struggling for cash, some even said to be on the verge of going under. No politician would want to tell a family or a young person that they shouldn’t be allowed to attend. But as one former senior official put it bluntly, “fees need to go up or they need to find alternative money.“ Another Whitehall figure suggested the question politicians aren’t willing to ask is: should so many people go? Though “vote for us, and we won’t help you get to university” won't be on any leaflets any time soon. Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Sir Keir, pictured here with Health Secretary Wes Streeting, has ditched plans to cap social care costs Then, there is tax. I’ve encountered a whole range of views on whether it’s fair to tax wealth and income so differently. Does the business tax system still work? (Not really, it’s claimed.) Shouldn’t it all be much simpler anyway? (Probably, most say.) But also, what no politician wants to say out loud in public - but many in Westminster regularly say in private - is how wildly out of date the council tax system is, based as it is on property values from 1991. You read that right. The size of your council tax bill, in England and Scotland, is based on what your flat or house was worth 33 years ago. You don’t need me to tell you that property values have changed an awful lot since then, and not in a uniform way. The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies says it means the tax is “out of date, regressive, and distorted”, creating unfairness between households, and councils too. There is no appetite in government to take a big look at the system. New Labour had a go, then backed away from any major changes. One source claimed it was “wonkish” to believe reform was a priority, and it wouldn’t necessarily raise any extra cash that might be useful for the Treasury coffers.

Published 6 days ago A tent city next to Mayfair: Why cutting homelessness might be harder than before Published 9 September There’s another whole list of anomalies in the status quo, that governments would never design now if you started with a blank page. But they haven’t got the bandwidth or desire to sort them out. Fourty-three different police forces in England and Wales? “It’s mad,” says one insider. A maze of different types of local government – “baffling”, says another. Then there are absolutely toxic political questions that most hardly even dare to whisper. Insiders wonder, can the model of the NHS survive for ever with an ageing population? Is it the right thing to subsidise the steel industry while it staggers on? There are clear consequences of ignoring an unsayable. For years, politicians didn’t want to say out loud that if you locked up more people (popular), you would also have to build more prisons (unpopular), or they would burst. Now, the new government has been pushed to do something unpalatable - early releases on a big scale - because the unsayable went unsaid. How far ministers will now go in being honest about any longer-term solutions for prisons? Watch this space. This government believes that focusing on short-term politics - which create new long-term problems - is “unforgiveable”. And it seems that genuinely, ministers want to get to grips with problems that have been building up in the country for many, many years. Yet, there is of course a limit to what they can do. One senior figure acknowledged, “an enormous majority gives a massive advantage which is political stability – that means you can do difficult things.” But addressing many of those long term problems is hard without a willingness or ability to spend a lot more cash, or take money away from other parts of the state. It’s “much easier when you have the money of Thatcher 1983-87 and Blair 2001-2007”, one former official suggests. When public finances are in trouble, they continue, “maybe it’s the right call to try to get growth first”, rather than ending up with more stubborn problems in a second term. They remark acidly: ""In a post-ideological age, no governments want to tackle these issues. The last one had 14 years to do so and didn’t."" But if we are to believe this government’s proclamations that they really want to pursue long-term solutions for the country’s ills, perhaps more of the unsayables will need to be said out loud. Sir Keir Starmer is making the case that ignoring problems in the long term is part of the reason for what has gone wrong. But when he vowed to do the “difficult things now”, the reality for any prime minister is that the list of difficult things can never be complete.

Is there still a chance to get justice for him? Published 13 September 2024 Daniel De Simone Investigations correspondent Stephen Lawrence would have turned 50 today. His racist murder in 1993, when he was aged only 18, stole his life. Amid the Metropolitan Police’s many failures, Stephen’s murder has never been fully solved and the 31 years since have been stolen, too, from his family, whose campaign for justice has been unceasing. Stephen was stabbed to death by a gang of five or six young white men. He had been with his friend Duwayne Brooks waiting for a bus in Eltham, south London. Only two of his killers have been convicted of murder, after a trial that concluded in 2012, meaning others responsible remain free. Another suspect has died. Stephen’s case is the Met’s best-known and most controversial murder. It generated one of the great justice campaigns in UK history and has changed policing, the law, and society. The Met knows the case matters to millions of people and it is a case I have spent a large amount of time investigating for the BBC. In 2020, the Met announced it was closing the murder investigation and that it had exhausted all viable lines of inquiry. Following this, I began investigating and, last year, the BBC publicly identified a major suspect for the first time and exposed decades of Met failures relating to him. For a long time, the suggestion that Stephen’s murder could ever be fully solved has seemed fanciful to many. But if you look closely, as I have done, there may, in fact, be a genuine opportunity for further charges. Image caption, Matthew White was named as a major suspect in 2023 after a BBC investigation The current situation is that in April this year, following a series of further BBC revelations and calls by Stephen’s mother, Baroness Doreen Lawrence, for the case to be reopened, the Met was forced by the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan to announce an independent review of the murder would take place. The mayor said the Lawrence family must be satisfied with the review. This review, as proposed, means there is the potential for the case to be reopened should fresh or neglected lines of inquiry be identified. Since then: stasis, despite a series of behind-the-scenes meetings and negotiations. The process is now nearing a conclusion and can really only end in one of two ways: with the setting-up of a review that the Lawrence family supports; or with one they do not support and which therefore may not take place at all. The review has been described as perhaps the last chance for justice by Imran Khan, the solicitor for Baroness Lawrence. An independent police force or body capable of taking on a review has not been agreed. Some forces were considered but deemed unsuitable. However, disagreements around the breadth and scope of the review have been the major stumbling block. No limits The Met has proposed that it should have a relatively narrow focus, looking at recent decision-making, mainly relating to the closure of the case in 2020 and how the force responded to my own investigation last year. This review would essentially be paper-based. Stephen’s family want a far broader review, with no limits on what can be examined - meaning much earlier decisions and investigations stretching back to 1993 would be in scope. The family think the Met may have neglected chances to bring the other killers to justice, something that can only be examined by a broad review with the power to make enquiries and speak to witnesses. The family are not asking for a full re-investigation of the whole case, but want a review that may lead to the case being formally reopened. To understand why this issue is so crucial, we need to consider both the history of the case and the recent revelations. The sheer number of investigations, inquiries, and other official processes spanning 31 years mean the case now, arguably, is uniquely complex, despite starting as one that should have been relatively straightforward to solve. This complexity is now being held up by the Met as a reason why it is impractical to carry out a full review or reinvestigation - but of course the Met’s own failure to deliver full justice is central to this complexity. The Met itself now accepts the first investigation in 1993 and 1994 was a failure. That investigation was lambasted in 1999 by the landmark Macpherson Report as having been “marred by a combination of professional incompetence, institutional racism and a failure of leadership”. Given this, the Met had, and has, no choice but to accept it was a disaster. But 1999 is now a long time ago. The Met has been defensive of its other investigations into the murder since that year, but then there hasn’t been another public inquiry examining its actions and producing official adverse findings after that point. The Met, bluntly, has seemed content to lay the blame for everything that has gone wrong with the case on the first investigation. When I have asked the force if it accepts failings by later investigations, it has not done so, despite clear evidence of failures in inquiries that took place after the publication of the Macpherson report. Image caption, Baroness Lawrence, pictured here in 2012, has campained for decades to get justice for her son's murder In terms of the first investigation, failures are still being uncovered and new opportunities for evidence are being identified. The suspect we named last year, Matthew White, was treated as a witness by the first investigation and was repeatedly referred to as such under an alias during Macpherson. But he was really a major suspect and the failure to identify him as one is arguably the worst of all those committed by the first investigating team. Lord Sentamu, who was part of the Macpherson Inquiry team, has told me the murder would have been resolved in the 1990s if White had been dealt with properly and that Sir William Macpherson, who is now dead, would have felt he had failed by not having identified the White issue during his inquiry. The fact that White’s stepfather had tried to tell the first investigation that White had admitted to being present during the murder was only uncovered in 2013 by Clive Driscoll, the officer who achieved the only two murder convictions in the case. He uncovered all this after reviewing notes and messages from the first investigation and then going out to speak to people on the ground, which is what Stephen’s family now want from the new review. Mr Driscoll was in the process of investigating White when he was made to retire early the next year and, from my own research, it is clear the Met did not subsequently fully pursue the lines of inquiry he was following, something the Met disputes. The Met has said it twice passed files on White to the Crown Prosecution Service. They ruled out murder charges, but my research has shown not everything possible was done prior to those files being submitted. When investigating the case, which has meant knocking on doors all over the country, I repeatedly found that evidence from the first investigation could not be taken at face value, and that probing and testing it could generate opportunities and fresh leads. Some witnesses have not been spoken to for many years, meaning the Met is not taking advantage of the fact that some people may now feel able to speak about what they know. It is a maxim of police appeals that, over time, allegiances can shift and minds can change. But time is not a friend - witnesses are getting old, and some have died even during the time I’ve been investigating the case. The Met’s focusing of the blame on what happened in 1993 and 1994, deflects from a critical examination of the various later investigations. These contained their own failures and therefore now hold their own opportunities as sources of evidence. After the Macpherson report was published in 1999, a major investigation codenamed Operation Athena Tower took place. It was vast and costly, and employed techniques typically associated with counter-terrorism, including surveillance and bugging. The Met have refused to acknowledge failures in Athena Tower, as it has about the investigation which preceded the closure decision in 2020. Neither resulted in any charges being brought. Indeed, the only successful Met investigation was the one run by Clive Driscoll between 2006 and 2014. Mr Driscoll, whom I got to know well during my own research, had repaired relations between the Met and the Lawrences, which subsequently collapsed again after he left the Met. The family view him as honest and determined to get to the bottom of the case, regardless of whether that highlights failures in the Met’s other inquiries. A sense of humiliation This is why both of Stephen’s parents have separately proposed that Mr Driscoll must have a role in the new review, and that has been accepted by the Met. But he has made it clear he will only take part in a review if its terms of reference are acceptable to the family. The context for all this is that, for some within the Met, there is a sense of humiliation about what’s been revealed about White since last year. Looking at the case with him as a suspect upends parts of the previously publicly accepted timeline of the night of the murder. Crucially, it further implicates the outstanding suspects and opens up evidential opportunities. Given what we now know about what was missing from the investigation into White prior to his death, Stephen’s family now questions what has not been done in relation to the outstanding living suspects - namely Luke Knight and brothers Neil and Jamie Acourt. They have always denied murder. There is now less fear in Eltham of the Acourts and the gangster father of David Norris, who was convicted of the murder in 2012. When I turned up to question the Acourts separately last year, they both fled and appeared very nervous. The Met said it would not comment on this article, but - in response to previous stories - the force has said it reiterates apologies about the mistakes made in the initial investigation. In July they said: “Earlier this year, we made the decision that we would seek an independent review of our recent approach to the murder of Stephen Lawrence, including material published by the BBC. “The terms of reference for the review are currently being discussed with Baroness Lawrence, Dr Lawrence and Duwayne Brooks."" There are leads that can still be pursued, which, should they go somewhere, could make a difference to the case. This information is also available within the Met and would be considered by the type of broad review proposed by Stephen’s family. There is some forensic evidence relating to a suspect. I know which suspect, but the BBC is not naming him. He does not know about the evidence and could yet face further investigation. Contrary to the organisation’s defensive public statements, a Met source has told me that, at senior levels within the Met, the force accepts various leads were left unfollowed when the investigation closed in 2020. But according to the source, the same senior members of the force do not feel under enough public pressure to reopen the case. My understanding is that the prevailing decision to keep the case closed is therefore not based on a cool balancing of all the evidence after every possible line of inquiry has been exhausted. It is a matter of will. Just as Stephen would now have been entering his 50s, the mother and father who have never stopped fighting for him are into their 70s and 80s, respectively. With unsolved murders, there can sometimes be a passive sense that, in time, we will somehow eventually find out what really happened. But, based on what I have found out about this case, uncovering what happened will require active effort. In the case of Stephen Lawrence, time itself will not reveal the truth.

Published 11 September 2024 Pallab Ghosh Science correspondent @BBCPallab There’s nothing new about genetic engineering. By cross-breeding plants and animals, our Stone Age ancestors realised they could boost the amount of food they produced. Modern genetics has enabled scientists to do much more: to make precise, targeted changes to the DNA of organisms in a lab. And that, they claim, will lead to new, more productive, disease-resistant crops and animals. The science is still in its infancy, but gene-edited foods are already on the shelves in Japan: tomatoes rich in a chemical that supposedly promotes calmness; red sea bream with extra edible flesh; and puffer fish that grow more quickly. In the US, too, firms are developing heat-resistant cattle, pit-less cherries and seedless blackberries. Supporters of the technology say it could reduce animal diseases and suffering and lead to the use of fewer antibiotics. They also believe it could tackle climate change by lowering emissions of the greenhouse gas methane - produced by livestock such as cows, goats and deer when their stomachs are breaking down hard fibres like grass for digestion. But opponents say gene editing is still not proven to be safe and that they remain concerned about the implications for animal welfare. Listen to Pallab Ghosh read this article Now a law permitting gene-edited food to be sold in the UK has been paused and some British scientists warn they could be overtaken by other countries. The new Labour government has pledged closer alignment with the European Union, particularly on regulations that might affect trade. And currently, the EU has much stricter rules around the commercial sale of gene-edited and genetically modified crops. The EU set stringent regulations on genetically modified (GM) crops decades ago because of safety concerns and public opposition to the technology. Gene-edited crops are covered by the same regulations. But to scientists, the terms “gene editing” and “GM” refer to different things. GM, a much older technology, involves adding new genes to plants and animals to make them more productive or disease-resistant. Sometimes these new genes were from entirely different species - for example , external , a cotton plant with a scorpion gene to make it taste unpleasant to insects. By contrast, gene editing involves making more precise changes to the plant or the animal’s DNA. These changes are often quite small ones, which involve editing sections of the DNA into a form that, its advocates say, could be produced through natural means like traditional cross-breeding, only much faster. Dashed hopes Along with the US and China, the UK is among the countries that lead the world in gene editing. Last year the previous government passed the Precision Breeding Act, which paved the way for the commercial sale of gene-edited food in England. At the time, many scientists working in the field were overjoyed. “I thought: ‘Great, this is going to uncork a whole area of activity in the public and private sector’ and we could build an entrepreneurial community for gene editing in the UK,” says Prof Jonathan Napier of Rothamsted Research, a government agricultural research institute in Harpenden. But he says his hopes were soon dashed. For the law to come into effect, secondary legislation was required, and this was due to be passed by Parliament this July. But the earlier-than-expected election meant that it was not voted on by MPs and the Act is currently in limbo. Prof Napier was among 50 leading scientists to write to the newly appointed ministers at the Department for Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) at the end of July asking them to act “quickly and decisively” to pass the secondary legislation. The Defra minister responsible, Daniel Zeichner, responded to the scientists’ plea last week by stating that the government was “now considering how to take forward the regulatory framework outlined in the Act and will share our plans with key interested parties soon”. One of the prime movers behind the scientists’ letter, leading expert Prof Tina Barsby, described the minister’s response as a “encouraging” but said that his promise of clarity “soon” had to mean really soon. Other countries, she said, were pressing ahead with their plans for gene edited-crops at great speed. Thailand recently joined Canada, Australia, Japan, Brazil, Argentina and the USA in adopting regulations around gene editing. Even New Zealand, which according to Prof Barsby “has historically taken a more cautious regulatory approach to genetic technologies”, has announced that it will also introduce new legislation. Prof Barsby added: “With our world-leading science base in genetic research, we cannot afford to be left behind.” But Defra ministers also have to consider the views of environmental campaigners, such as Dr Helen Wallace of Genewatch UK, who have concerns about the “unwanted consequences” of the Precision Breeding Act. “If you remove these plants and animals from GM regulations then you don’t have the same degree of risk assessment, you don’t have labelling and you risk markets because many of them regulate them as GMOs,” she says. Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Sceptics of gene editing worry about what it will mean for the welfare of animals Dr Peter Stevenson, who is the chief policy advisor to UK-based Compassion in World Farming (CIWF), also fears that the technology will further add to the intensification of animal farming - with negative consequences. “The use of selective breeding over the past 50 years has brought a huge number of animal welfare problems,” he says. “Chickens have been bred to grow so quickly that their legs and hearts can’t properly support the rapidly developing body and as a result millions of animals are suffering from painful leg disorders, while others succumb to heart disease. “Do we really want to accelerate this process with gene editing?” CIWF’s biggest fear is that gene-editing animals to make them more resistant to diseases will mean that the industry will not be motivated to deal with the conditions that lead to the animals getting ill in the first place - such as crowded, unsanitary conditions. The intensity of the production of milk, meat, and eggs currently leaves many animals “exhausted and broken”, Mr Stevenson told BBC News. Any genetic alteration to an animal has the potential to have negative effects. But advocates say that for any commercial application, firms have to demonstrate to the regulator that their changes do not harm the animal and back this up with data. Indeed, many of those who argue for the use of gene-editing technology do so partly on animal welfare grounds - because it could make farm animals more resistant to disease and, since fewer would die as a result, fewer would be needed in the first place. Another of the letter’s signatories is Prof Helen Sang, who has laid the foundations for using gene editing to develop bird flu resistance in chickens. “With a virulent strain of (the pig disease) PRRS wiping out pig herds in Spain, African Swine Fever on the march north through Europe, and bird flu virus detected in both dairy cattle and their milk in the US, the importance of enabling all possible solutions, including precision breeding, cannot be overstated,” she said in response to Mr Zeichner. Some of the solutions to the problems Prof Sang mentions are already waiting in the wings. She works at the Roslin Institute, where Dolly the Sheep was cloned nearly 30 years ago. It now leads the world in developing gene-edited animals. Image source, Getty Images Image caption, In July 1996, scientists at the Roslin Institute cloned Dolly the sheep Prof Sang’s colleagues at Roslin developed a strain of pig that is resistant to the PRRS pig disease six years ago. They can’t yet be commercially sold to UK pig farmers - but Genus, a British company that has commercialised the PRRS-resistant pigs, has received regulatory approval for their use in Colombia. The firm also has an application for permission to introduce the pigs to the US market which, if given the green light, could be approved as early as next spring. Genus is also planning to seek approval for the commercial use of their gene-edited pigs in Canada, Mexico and Japan. Despite the strong opinions on both sides, there appears to be scope for consensus around some applications of the technology. For instance, Mr Stevenson of CIWF does think it’s at least possible that gene editing could be applied in an ethical way. To do so, he says, it would need to meet three criteria: that any change it brings about is unlikely to cause animal welfare problems; that its objectives cannot be met by any less intensive means; and that it will not have the effect of entrenching industrialised livestock production. The PRRS-resistant pigs may tick all three boxes in specific circumstances, according to Mr Stevenson, as do efforts to use gene editing to enable the egg-production industry to produce female-only chicks to avoid the need for billions of male chicks being killed each year when they are just a day old. Likewise, Prof Mizeck Chagunda, who is the director of the Centre for Tropical Genetics and Health, which is also based at the Roslin Institute, believes both in the positive potential of gene editing and that it needs to be carefully overseen. He says the technology could improve the lives of the poorest farmers in the world: “70% to 80% of farmers are smallholding farms with two to three animals.” A devastating disease can leave a farmer and their family with nothing. “So, giving them animals that have been prepared with these technologies would help to protect them from this huge risk to their livelihoods,” says Prof Chagunda. However, Prof Chagunda warns that there needs to be good, strong regulations in place if this technology is to be accepted by the public. “Some changes can be too experimental, and we should not be doing them,” he says. “Scientists should be working with the regulatory authorities to achieve the good products that the farmers and consumers are looking for. We should be doing science that is ethical and at the same time helping humanity.” The gene editing work at Roslin is led by its director, Prof Bruce Whitelaw, who was a scientist at the institute when Dolly the sheep was cloned. In the past he has been through the process of explaining the potential benefits of seemingly alarming technological developments and he believes there is an urgent need to do so again now. “We are world leaders in the technology and sitting at top table in terms of developing it,” he says. “If we don’t have the legislation to do that, then our credentials to sit there will slowly wither away and we will lose investment, scientific talent and the boost to our economy to other countries.” More from InDepth A tent city next to Mayfair: Why cutting homelessness might be harder than before Published 9 September Why is the Pope doing a long tour when he's so frail? Published 8 September Starmer's 'blame the Tories' strategy will not hold forever Published 7 September There are lessons here from the past. Genetic modification was rejected by many consumers in the UK, the European Union and other countries 30 years ago because of its perceived unnaturalness. GM crops were publicly trampled by protestors who saw this as a technology that they didn’t need, want or consider safe. At the same time, scientists were angry and upset that what they believed to be their world-saving technology was being destroyed by, in their view, a wave of anti-scientific hysteria fuelled by the media. Gene editing seems to be a more palatable version of GM to some, arriving at a time when the debate is less polarised, the need for environmental solutions is even more urgent and there seems to be a greater readiness for some scientists and campaigners to see each other’s perspectives. Mr Stevenson of CWIF believes that in the long run, there has to be “huge reductions” in global livestock production to deal with climate change, but pragmatically, the fact that climate change is already destroying so many lives, the use of gene editing could be “legitimate”. But he is wary. “It is hard for me to trust that part of the scientific world who say: ‘Hey now, we have a new way to alter animals.’ “The danger is of animals being thought of as things, units of production, more so than they are now, because we can modify them to make them more amenable to our uses and taking us away from this notion of animals as sentient beings.” What happens next, not just in the UK, but the rest of the world, depends on whether the advocates of gene editing can convince the open-minded, but wary, such as Mr Stevenson, that they can act safely, ethically and in a way that makes lives better, not worse - for people and animals alike.

"A tent city next to Mayfair: Why cutting homelessness might be harder than before - BBC News BBC Homepage Skip to content Accessibility Help Your account Notifications Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds Bitesize More menu More menu Search BBC Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds Bitesize CBBC CBeebies Food Close menu BBC News Menu Home InDepth Israel-Gaza war US election Cost of Living War in Ukraine Climate UK World Business More Politics Culture Tech Science Health Family & Education In Pictures Newsbeat BBC Verify Disability InDepth A tent city next to Mayfair: Why cutting homelessness might be harder than before Published 9 September 2024 Michael Buchanan Social affairs correspondent On a recent evening, on one of London’s most exclusive roads, an estate agent was selling a property for £16.5m. Outside the agency, on the other side of Park Lane, was an encampment of approximately 24 tents housing rough sleepers. Some were sitting outside, taking in the warm night air. Others were reading by torchlight. Rough sleeping is on the rise across England but the tents like these increasingly appearing in the country’s towns and cities are only the most visible signs of a much bigger problem. Homelessness is, by some measures, at record levels. Over 150,000 children, for instance, are living in temporary accommodation, often miles from their schools and their friends. On occasion, some are forced to live with their entire family in one cramped, sometimes mouldy, room. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner says England is in the “middle of the worst housing crisis in living memory”. To tackle this, the new government is proposing to set up a homelessness reduction unit and in its manifesto, Labour said it would “put Britain back on track to ending homelessness”. This might sound ambitious, but homelessness is something that governments have successfully tackled previously. Listen to Michael Buchanan read this article In 1999, Tony Blair committed to reducing the number of rough sleepers by two-thirds in three years. By 2002, his government declared it had achieved its target a year early - the number of rough sleepers in England had fallen from 1,850 to 532. These numbers remained low for most of the remainder of the decade. The method the government uses to count rough sleeping has changed over the years but experts agree that rough sleeping fell under Labour. In 2010, when the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition took office, the figures showed an 11-year low of 440 rough sleepers on any given night. However the then-Housing Minister Grant Shapps said he was “sceptical” that the figures reflected “the true situation on the streets” and so the counting method was revised. Under the new methodology, the number of rough sleepers in England stood at 1,768 in 2010. After that the numbers rose, peaking in 2017. Now, the latest official figures , external put it at 3,898 - 120% higher than in 2010. Even during the pandemic, when the Conservatives pursued an “Everyone In” effort to protect rough sleepers from Covid - often using hotels that couldn’t accept paying guests - the number of people sleeping outside never fell below 2,400. The evidence of the Blair years gives Labour the confidence, however, to say it knows how to cut homelessness. But repeating the trick in 2024 may not be as easy as it was before. And most experts believe the latest figure is a huge underestimate. The annual snapshot, which counts the number of people found to be rough sleeping on a single night each autumn, was found by the UK Statistics Authority to fall short in “trustworthiness, quality, and value”. It doesn’t include, for instance, a person known to be a rough sleeper, but not visible on the night of the count. And it’s not just the numbers that are greater today - the type of rough sleeper is different, too. Image source, Alamy Image caption, Councils have entered into expensive deals to tackle homelessness costs The occupants of the tents on Park Lane were mostly Romanians. Indeed in London, for which the data is most detailed and up-to-date, 55% of rough sleepers are not from the UK. Back in the 1990s, rough sleepers in London were predominantly British and Irish. One obvious solution today would be to help those people from abroad return home. But while such reconnecting schemes do exist, it isn’t that simple, says Matt Downie, chief executive of homeless charity Crisis. He says that some are victims of modern slavery, others have the right to remain in the UK. “It needs untangling – they’re not all professional rough sleepers,” Mr Downie says. Relying on the private rented sector, as councils usually do to tackle homelessness, is becoming increasingly difficult, too. While Labour points out its commitment to ending so-called “no-fault evictions”, private rents in some areas have soared in recent years - up 9.7% in London in the year to June 2024, and 8.6% across England. In addition, the short-term rental market, such as Airbnb, has reduced the number of properties that councils can use. London, for instance, is reportedly the city with the most Airbnb listings in the world, totalling over 150,000 - out of more than half a million across the UK. As a result, the cost of housing families in temporary accommodation has soared. Councils spent more than £1bn on it last year, and the problem is pushing some local authorities towards bankruptcy. Several councils were forced to enter into expensive deals with the last Conservative government to cover the soaring costs of homelessness. Treasury rules mean that Whitehall will only reimburse local authorities 90% of a figure calculated in 2011 for the cost of temporary accommodation, leading to an average monthly shortfall of about £350 per household, according to Mr Downie. All this means the Starmer government will face a more difficult and more expensive task than its predecessor in the 1990s and 2000s. ‘Banging heads together’ There are, however, lessons the new ministers can take from the last Labour government, according to those who were there. The key to the Blair administration’s success was getting the prime minister’s name and influence attached to the target, says Ian Brady, who was deputy director of the Rough Sleepers Unit at the time. Tony Blair, he said, would hold regular meetings with key ministers to see what progress was being made, “banging heads together if necessary”. There was money behind the initiative - £250m over three years - recalls Mr Brady, “a relatively big budget”. And different government departments were forced to help achieve this goal, including the Home Office and the Department of Health. After that, a three-pronged strategy was adopted. Officials gathered data to understand who was sleeping rough. Those already in homeless accommodation, such as hostels, were moved into the private rented sector - allowing others to come off the streets. And lots of support services, such as drug and alcohol treatment, were put in place to ensure people did not become homeless again. There are potential lessons from the Conservatives’ term in office, too. In 2018, they funded three pilot studies of a scheme that has proven successful in tackling rough sleeping in the United States and Europe and had already been introduced in Scotland. Housing First moves rough sleepers straight into their own properties and provides support services to help them maintain their homes. Tenancies can be kept, for instance, even if someone receives a short prison sentence or struggles to maintain contact with their drug and alcohol team. The pilots were deemed to have been a success , external , with an official analysis concluding that “the vast majority of clients were in long-term accommodation a year after entering Housing First and reported significantly better outcomes across a range of measures”. But the government has not said if it will introduce the scheme across the country, with some experts worried that it does not help enough people for the cost of the programme. Image source, Alamy Image caption, As well as rough sleeping, temporary accommodation is on the rise The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has committed to ending rough sleeping in the city by 2030. He has not laid out the full details yet, but has promised that council house building will be a key plank – since 2018, says Mr Khan, London has built more than twice as many council homes as the rest of England combined. Despite that, London has the biggest homelessness problem in England. The Conservative government, in 2019, made a similar commitment to end rough sleeping by the end of the last Parliament but failed to achieve it, despite spending over £500m tackling the problem between 2022 and 2025. In any case, rough sleeping is not the most significant homelessness issue. The latest figures from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government showed there were almost 120,000 households living in temporary accommodation - a record high , external - including those 150,000 children. More than 3,200 children were living in bed and breakfast accommodation for longer than the legal limit of six weeks, a figure that is up by almost 2,000% since the last time Labour were in power. “It’s a national disgrace,” says Ian Brady. “I wouldn’t neglect what’s happening on the streets, but I’d start by tackling that problem.” An expert, who has the ear of the new government, said one approach would be to keep those women and children who are fleeing domestic violence in their homes and force their partners to move out by using a different policing approach. Finding properties for those families who do end up homeless will not be easy, however. The 1.5m homes the government has committed to building during the lifetime of this Parliament will take some time to appear, yet the homeless problem is both immediate and urgent. In an effort to tackle the limited supply of social housing, the government is expected to hold a consultation on the future of Right to Buy, the scheme that allows council tenants to buy their homes, often at a significant discount. Matt Downie from Crisis would go further. “I would immediately suspend Right to Buy. It’s been a disaster,” he says. Since the policy was introduced in 1980, of the almost two million homes that have been sold through Right to Buy, Shelter estimates that just 4% have been replaced. However even if Right to Buy were to be ended entirely, some commentators say , external annual sales only represent a small proportion of social housing stock and further action would still be needed to tackle the shortage of social housing. Mr Downie would also urge the government to align the allocations system for social housing in England with what happens in Scotland, so that homeless families get priority when properties become available.

The Ministry of Justice often releases prisoners into the community knowing they have nowhere to live while the Home Office has been evicting asylum seekers from their accommodation within days of giving them permission to remain in the UK, often onto the streets. Ms Rayner has promised “a long-term strategy across Government to deal with every pressure – including increasing social and affordable housing, and providing support for refugees leaving the asylum system and prison leavers”. Such an approach, she says, “will get us back on track towards ending homelessness for good”. The challenge the new government faces in tackling homelessness is much greater than the last time Labour were in office. But the potential rewards are also even greater, not just in terms of saving money but in giving so many thousands of families the dignity and certainty that comes with having a place to call home.

His half-brother, Salman, was about to become king – and Salman’s favourite son, Mohammed bin Salman, was preparing for power. The prince, known simply by his initials MBS and then just 29 years old, had big plans for his kingdom, the biggest plans in its history; but he feared that plotters within his own Saudi royal family could eventually move against him. So at midnight one evening that month, he summoned a senior security official to the palace, determined to win his loyalty. The official, Saad al-Jabri, was told to leave his mobile phone on a table outside. MBS did the same. The two men were now alone. The young prince was so fearful of palace spies that he pulled the socket out of the wall, disconnecting the only landline telephone. According to Jabri, MBS then talked about how he would wake his kingdom up from its deep slumber, allowing it to take its rightful place on the global stage. By selling a stake in the state oil producer Aramco, the world’s most profitable company, he would begin to wean his economy off its dependency on oil. He would invest billions in Silicon Valley tech startups including the taxi firm, Uber. Then, by giving Saudi women the freedom to join the workforce, he would create six million new jobs. Astonished, Jabri asked the prince about the extent of his ambition. “Have you heard of Alexander the Great?” came the simple reply. MBS ended the conversation there. A midnight meeting that was scheduled to last half-an-hour had gone on for three. Jabri left the room to find several missed calls on his mobile from government colleagues worried about his long disappearance. The Kingdom: The World’s Most Powerful Prince The story of the extraordinary rise to power of the man who runs Saudi Arabia and whose control of oil affects everyone, starting with how he outwitted hundreds of rivals to become crown prince. Watch on BBC iPlayer For the past year, our documentary team has been talking to both Saudi friends and opponents of MBS, as well as senior Western spies and diplomats. The Saudi government was given the opportunity to respond to the claims made in the BBC’s films and in this article. They chose not to do so. Saad al-Jabri was so high up in the Saudi security apparatus that he was friends with the heads of the CIA and MI6. While the Saudi government has called Jabri a discredited former official, he’s also the most well-informed Saudi dissident to have dared speak about how the crown prince rules Saudi Arabia – and the rare interview he has given us is astonishing in its detail. By gaining access to many who know the prince personally, we shed new light on the events that have made MBS notorious – including the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the launch of a devastating war in Yemen . With his father increasingly frail, the 38-year-old MBS is now de facto in charge of the birthplace of Islam and the world’s biggest exporter of oil. He’s begun to carry out many of the groundbreaking plans he described to Saad al-Jabri – while also being accused of human rights violations including the suppression of free speech, widespread use of the death penalty and jailing of women's rights activists. An inauspicious start The first king of Saudi Arabia fathered at least 42 sons, including MBS’s father, Salman. The crown has traditionally been passed down between these sons. It was when two of them suddenly died in 2011 and 2012 that Salman was elevated into the line of succession. Western spy agencies make it their business to study the Saudi equivalent of Kremlinology – working out who will be the next king. At this stage, MBS was so young and unknown that he wasn’t even on their radar. “He grew up in relative obscurity,” says Sir John Sawers, chief of MI6 until 2014. “He wasn’t earmarked to rise to power.” Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Mohammed bin Salman always felt the need to prove himself among his fellow Saudi royals, according to a former UK offical The crown prince also grew up in a palace in which bad behaviour had few, if any, consequences ; and that may help explain his notorious habit of not thinking through the impact of his decisions until he had already made them. MBS first achieved notoriety in Riyadh in his late teens, when he was nicknamed “Abu Rasasa” or “Father of the Bullet”, after allegedly sending a bullet in the post to a judge who had overruled him in a property dispute. “He has had a certain ruthlessness,” observes Sir John Sawers. “He doesn’t like to be crossed. But that also means he’s been able to drive through changes that no other Saudi leader has been able to do.” Among the most welcome changes, the former MI6 chief says, has been cutting off Saudi funding to overseas mosques and religious schools that became breeding grounds for Islamist jihadism – at huge benefit to the safety of the West. MBS’s mother, Fahda, is a Bedouin tribeswoman and seen as the favourite of his father’s four wives. Western diplomats believe the king has suffered for many years from a slow-onset form of vascular dementia ; and MBS was the son he turned to for help. Several diplomats recalled for us their meetings with MBS and his father. The prince would write notes on an iPad, then send them to his father’s iPad, as a way of prompting what he would say next. BBC Sounds - Mohammed bin Salman: The unstoppable prince? The prince was apparently so impatient for his father to become king that in 2014, he reportedly suggested killing the then-monarch – Abdullah, his uncle – with a poisoned ring, obtained from Russia. “I don’t know for sure if he was just bragging, but we took it seriously,” says Jabri. The former senior security official says he has seen a secretly recorded surveillance video of MBS talking about the idea. “He was banned from court, from shaking hands with the king, for a considerable amount of time.” In the event, the king died of natural causes, allowing his brother, Salman, to assume the throne in 2015. MBS was appointed Defence Minister and lost no time in going to war. War in Yemen Two months later, the prince led a Gulf coalition into war against the Houthi movement, which had seized control of much of western Yemen and which he saw as a proxy of Saudi Arabia’s regional rival Iran. It triggered a humanitarian disaster, with millions on the brink of famine. “It wasn’t a clever decision,” says Sir John Jenkins, who was British ambassador just before the war began. “One senior American military commander told me they had been given 12 hours’ notice of the campaign, which is unheard of.” The military campaign helped turn a little-known prince into a Saudi national hero. However, it was also the first of what even his friends believe have been several major mistakes. A recurring pattern of behaviour was emerging: MBS’s tendency to jettison the traditionally slow and collegiate system of Saudi decision-making, preferring to act unpredictably or upon impulse; and refusing to kowtow to the US, or be treated as head of a backward client state. Jabri goes much further, accusing MBS of forging his father the king’s signature on a royal decree committing ground troops.

Published 9 August Jabri says he discussed the Yemen war in the White House before it started; and that Susan Rice, President Obama’s National Security Advisor, warned him that the US would only support an air campaign. However, Jabri claims MBS was so determined to press ahead in Yemen that he ignored the Americans. “We were surprised that there was a royal decree to allow the ground interventions,” Jabri says. “He forged the signature of his dad for that royal decree. The king’s mental capacity was deteriorating.” Jabri says his source for this allegation was “credible, reliable” and linked to the Ministry of Interior where he was chief of staff. Jabri recalls the CIA station chief in Riyadh telling him how angry he was that MBS had ignored the Americans, adding that the invasion of Yemen should never have happened. The former MI6 chief Sir John Sawers says that while he doesn’t know if MBS forged the documents, “it is clear that this was MBS’s decision to intervene militarily in Yemen. It wasn’t his father’s decision, although his father was carried along with it.” We’ve discovered that MBS saw himself as an outsider from the very beginning - a young man with much to prove and a refusal to obey anybody’s rules other than his own. Kirsten Fontenrose, who served on President Donald Trump’s National Security Council, says that when she read the CIA’s in-house psychological profile of the prince, she felt it missed the point. “There were no prototypes to base him on,” she says. “He has had unlimited resources. He has never been told ‘no’. He is the first young leader to reflect a generation that, frankly, most of us in government are too old to understand.” Making his own rules MBS’s purchase of a famous painting in 2017 tells us much about how he thinks, and his willingness to be a risk-taker, unafraid to be out of step with the religiously conservative society that he governs. And above all, determined to outplay the West in conspicuous displays of power. In 2017, a Saudi prince reportedly acting for MBS , external spent $450m (£350m) on the Salvator Mundi, which remains the world’s most expensive work of art ever sold .

For almost seven years, ever since the auction, it has completely disappeared , external . Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Whether the Salvator Mundi, a 500-year-old painting of Christ, was painted by Leonardo da Vinci is contested Bernard Haykel, who speaks regularly to the crown prince and is a Professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University, says that despite rumours that it hangs in the prince's yacht or palace, the painting is actually in storage in Geneva and that MBS intends to hang it in a museum in the Saudi capital that has not yet been built. “I want to build a very large museum in Riyadh,” Haykel quotes MBS as saying. “And I want an anchor object that will attract people, just like the Mona Lisa does.” Similarly, his plans for sport reflect someone who is both hugely ambitious and unafraid to disrupt the status quo. Saudi Arabia’s incredible spending spree on world-class sport – it is the sole bidder to host the FIFA World Cup in 2034, and has made multimillion-dollar investments in staging tournaments for tennis and golf – has been called “sportswashing”. But what we found is a leader who cares less about what the West thinks of him than he does about demonstrating the opposite: that he will do whatever he wants in the name of making himself and Saudi Arabia great. “MBS is interested in building his own power as a leader,” says Sir John Sawers, the former Chief of MI6, who has met him. “And the only way he can do that is by building his country’s power. That’s what’s driving him.” Jabri’s 40-year career as a Saudi official did not survive MBS’s consolidation of power. Chief of staff for the former Crown Prince Muhammed bin Nayef, he fled the kingdom as MBS was taking over, after being tipped off by a foreign intelligence service that he could be in danger. But Jabri says MBS texted him out of the blue, offering him his old job back. “It was bait – and I didn’t bite,” Jabri says, convinced he would have been tortured, imprisoned or killed if he returned. As it was, his teenage children, Omar and Sarah, were detained and later jailed for money laundering and for trying to escape – charges that they deny. The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has called for their release , external . “He planned for my assassination,” Jabri says. “He will not rest until he sees me dead, I have no doubt about that.” Saudi officials have issued Interpol notices for Jabri’s extradition from Canada, without success. They claim he is wanted for corruption involving billions of dollars during his time at the interior ministry. However, he was given the rank of major-general and credited by the CIA and MI6 with helping to prevent al-Qaeda terrorist attacks . Khashoggi’s killing The killing of Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018 implicates MBS in ways that are very hard to refute. The 15-strong hit squad was travelling on diplomatic passports and included several of MBS’s own bodyguards. Khashoggi’s body has never been found and is believed to have been hacked into pieces with a bone saw. Professor Haykel exchanged WhatsApp messages with MBS not long after the murder. “I was asking, ‘how could this happen?’,” Haykel recalls. “I think he was in deep shock. He didn’t realise the reaction to this was going to be as deep.” The veteran US diplomat Dennis Ross met MBS shortly afterwards. “He said he didn’t do it and that it was a colossal blunder,” says Ross. “I certainly wanted to believe him, because I couldn’t believe that he could authorise something [like] that.” Image source, Reuters Image caption, Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi had criticised the policies of MBS MBS has always denied knowledge of the plot, although in 2019 he said he took “responsibility"" , external because the crime happened on his watch. A declassified US intelligence report released in February 2021 asserted that he was complicit in the killing of Khashoggi. I asked those who know MBS personally whether he had learned from his mistakes; or whether having survived the Khashoggi affair, it had in fact emboldened him. “He’s learned lessons the hard way,” says Professor Haykel, who says MBS resents the case being used as cudgel against him and his country, but that a killing like Khashoggi’s would not happen again. Sir John Sawers cautiously agrees that the murder was a turning point. “I think he has learned some lessons. The personality, though, remains the same.” His father, King Salman, is now aged 88. When he dies, MBS could rule Saudi Arabia for the next 50 years. However, he has recently admitted he fears being assassinated, possibly as a consequence of his attempts to normalise Saudi-Israeli ties. “I think there are lots of people who want to kill him,” says Professor Haykel, “and he knows it.” Eternal vigilance is what keeps a man like MBS safe. It was what Saad al-Jabri observed at the beginning of the prince’s rise to power, when he pulled the telephone socket out of the wall before speaking to him in his palace. MBS is still a man on a mission to modernise his country, in ways his predecessors would never have dared. But he’s also not the first autocrat who runs the risk of being so ruthless that nobody around him dares prevent him from making more mistakes.

"Why does the Church of England struggle to address abuse claims? - BBC News BBC Homepage Skip to content Accessibility Help Your account Notifications Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds Bitesize More menu More menu Search BBC Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds Bitesize CBBC CBeebies Food Close menu BBC News Menu Home InDepth Israel-Gaza war US election Cost of Living War in Ukraine Climate UK World Business More Politics Culture Tech Science Health Family & Education In Pictures Newsbeat BBC Verify Disability InDepth Why does the Church of England struggle to deal with child abuse allegations? Published 15 August 2024 Aleem Maqbool Religion editor Steve Swann BBC News After decades of controversies and dozens of survivors speaking out, the Church of England still faces fierce criticism for the way it responds when members of the clergy are accused of abuse. A BBC investigation into how it dealt with allegations about Blackburn priest Andrew Hindley exposed deep and continuing failings in the Church’s child protection system. After the news about Canon Hindley broke earlier this week, the current Dean of Blackburn, the Very Revd Peter Howell-Jones, acknowledged there had been “a meteoric failure of structure and systems which should have been addressed years before”. Asked if - given the details we now know - he trusts the Church to which he belongs, the Dean said, “I categorically do not.” Canon Hindley was offered a secret six-figure pay-off after being assessed as a potential risk to children and young people. The priest, who denies any criminal activity or wrongdoing, was subject to five police investigations, including into allegations of sexual assault, but has never been charged with any crime. Unable to rely on criminal prosecutions, the Church commissioned risk assessments by child protection experts. Several concluded Canon Hindley posed a potential risk to children and young people. But he remained in post. Image source, SWNS Image caption, Andrew Hindley has always denied any wrongdoing Church leaders say they were bound by their procedures and, when those failed, they had only one option: a financial settlement. The Church told the BBC this was to end a legal claim made by the priest after he was forced to retire early, although we revealed there had been earlier unsuccessful attempts to pay him off. So where exactly did the Church’s procedures fail? Some of the new details that we reveal here about decisions made during the process are staggering. But after so many scandals, reviews and inquiries over the years, the question for many is why things have not been put right before now. Some within the institution itself have expressed their exasperation. “If the Church, of which I am part, had begun to address some of its structures 10 or 15 years before, these things may never have happened and I’m deeply sorry for that,” said the Very Revd Peter Howell-Jones. Long-time observers of Church of England practices are starting to put the continued failings down to more just a lack of understanding of what needs to be done. “I have serious concerns about the attitudes and the willingness [of the Church] to get its house in order. I'm not sure that willingness is there at this time, and I don't believe that the Church has a comprehensive commitment to learn from experience,” says child protection expert, Dr Ian Elliott. Dr Elliott has carried out safeguarding reviews of religious institutions across the world. He says that while Canon Hindley’s case is unusual, serious problems with Church safeguarding have been pointed out many times before. That includes Dr Elliott’s own review of the Church of England published in 2016, in which he was critical of safeguarding practices and urged changes including better ways to intervene and improved independent oversight. He considers the Blackburn Cathedral case involving Canon Hindley further proof that recommendations have not been implemented. The controversial way that the saga ended was as a result of Church officials apparently believing they did not have legal grounds to remove him from post. “You have to intervene, to eliminate and manage the risk that has been identified. And that has to come first, before legal considerations,” say Dr Elliott A long timeline of allegations Canon Hindley, 65, told the BBC he was the target of a campaign to drive him from the church that was motivated by homophobia and personal agendas. But allegations of inappropriate behaviour spanned from the 1990s to the most recent formal complaints made in 2018. He finally left his townhouse on cathedral grounds in 2022. The case was a test of the safeguarding regime the Church of England had built in the early 2000s. In the glare of uncomfortable headlines about abuse scandals, its aim was to put vulnerable people at the centre of decisions. At its heart was a disciplinary system that, through hearings, was supposed to investigate and potentially remove members of clergy accused of misconduct. Some now blame that very system for the drawn-out handling of the case. And despite concerns within the Church about the risks Canon Hindley posed, he was never subject to any hearings. In 2007, Canon Hindley was suspended under the system - reportedly the most senior cleric at the time to face such sanction - after he was accused of an inappropriate discussion with a 15-year-old boy who was doing work experience at Blackburn Cathedral. Image caption, Blackburn Cathedral was the focal point of safeguarding concerns He denied wrongdoing and a complaint of “conduct unbecoming of a priest” was dropped after the boy’s parents withdrew permission for their son to be involved in the proceedings. Over the years, numerous subsequent opportunities were missed for complaints against Canon Hindley to be investigated and acted on within the Church. One was in 2019, when he was accused of sexually assaulting a young male colleague by touching his genitals. The alleged incident had happened in 2016, but when the complaint was made the case was stopped from going to a Church tribunal hearing because more than 12 months had passed since the alleged incident. The decision to allow some types of Church disciplinary case to progress rests with a key official called the President of Tribunals. The President and their deputy are roles taken by senior judges and are appointed by the Church. One of these gatekeepers played a key part in stopping another disciplinary case against Canon Hindley going ahead in 2020. It concerned an alleged victim of Canon Hindley, referred to in leaked church papers as Boy C. He had tried for almost 20 years to have his complaint aired. A later internal Church report said that Boy C was a credible witness and that his allegations were that he was “befriended and groomed by Andrew Hindley which led to him participating in sexual acts with him, acts which he now considers to constitute a sexual assault. He feels he was taken advantage of as a naive and vulnerable young person.” The allegation was investigated by police in 2001 but discontinued. This was because Boy C originally told officers he was 18 at the time of the alleged incident, but later said he was 17, which was then below the age of consent for sex between men. This change of account was assessed by prosecutors to undermine the chances of conviction. With the police investigation ended, and Canon Hindley always denying wrongdoing in the case, Boy C turned to the Church to do something about the allegations. But on five separate occasions, the case was stopped from going to internal hearings. The final time - in April 2020 - Sir Mark Hedley, Deputy President of Tribunals, made what appears to be a startling ruling. He documented that while he thought that it could be proved the case involved non-consensual sex, he could not be sure if the alleged victim was 17 or 18 at the time, so the case could not go forward to a tribunal. Sir Mark, who no longer serves in this position, told the BBC that his only legal consideration was the age of Boy C, because at that time, adults only had 12 months to make a complaint. In fact, the rules had been changed in 2016 to allow adults considered vulnerable to have cases progressed. Safeguarding expert Dr Ian Elliott says that the decision to not proceed with the case points to a system in disarray. “You’re not trying to apply a criteria of ‘beyond all reasonable doubt’ within safeguarding. You're not going to reach that level of proof. But from a safeguarding point of view, you can't lose sight of the fact that you must act.” ‘The Archbishops had no power to act’ One more instance in this case drew an astonishing response from the Church’s top leadership. It followed allegations Canon Hindley had indecently assaulted a woman, “improperly kissed” a teenage girl and “improperly touched two other men” at a party in the cathedral gardens in May 2018. The police investigated but again no criminal charges were brought. Canon Hindley, who was suspended, denied sexual assault, but in papers we have seen he conceded, “I did not cover myself in glory.” In April 2020 the same official, Sir Mark Hedley, ruled: “Whilst alcohol provides no defence to assault, for an assault to be constituted, there does have to be some degree of deliberation.” He dismissed the case. When the BBC asked why the alleged assaults were not brought to hearings, Sir Mark said his “decision was made after careful consideration of all the material available“ including an internal Church investigation into the incident. Nevertheless, the ruling was greeted with “profound unease” by senior people at Blackburn Cathedral, who wrote to the Archbishops of Canterbury and York asking them to intervene. But that intervention in the disciplinary process, even just to allow cases to proceed to gathering more evidence and conducting hearings, did not happen. The Church of England told the BBC: “The Archbishops had no power to affect the outcome and there is no way in which they could lawfully have intervened.” From documents, we do know that some Church leaders were trying to do what they thought was the right thing, but felt they had to bypass their own disciplinary system and resort to extreme measures. The options included a drastic proposal to close Blackburn Cathedral completely “to keep people safe”, and Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby also suggested leaking details of the situation to the press. We put the latter point to Lambeth Palace but did not receive a response on this specific question.

It points to a dysfunctional state of affairs, albeit with some Church leaders feeling they had little choice in their efforts to protect children and vulnerable young people. Good child protection practices are expected of all organisations, but perhaps it is even more incumbent on religious institutions to get things right because of the moral leadership many expect of them.

Published 9 August Starmer will be judged on how he tackles root causes of riots Published 11 August What does science tell us about boxing’s gender row? Published 9 August Survivors’ trauma Speak to survivors of Church of England abuse and many will report feeling they have been, and in some cases still are, treated with contempt. Many are also still waiting for their own financial settlements, for compensation for what they endured. Safeguarding professional Dr Ian Elliott is concerned the pay-off to Canon Hindley will “hurt and shock” survivors. “It really turns the knife for them. I haven't talked to any survivors within the Church of England who feel any compensation they received has been generous, and they would say it has been very hard-won,” Dr Elliott said. In fact, a compensation scheme for survivors promised by the Church has yet to be established. Last year, the BBC discovered that the Church’s Independent Safeguarding Board (ISB) found that an interim scheme set up to help survivors while they waited for compensation actually risked re-traumatising victims. This is because people who have suffered abuse at the hands of an institution may experience further trauma when that institution fails to handle their complaints. In a report, the ISB said the support scheme appeared to have been “set up in haste, underthought and under-resourced”. Soon after, the board was disbanded with the Church saying relations between the independent experts on the board and bishops had “broken down”. Two of the three-member board, both experienced safeguarding professionals, had previously said the Church had been obstructive, and had interfered in their work. These are issues playing out now. But dare to look a little further and there is more cause for concern. A review in 2022 found there were at least 383 Church abuse cases that either have never been dealt with or were left unresolved. This is not to say there are not good people within the Church of England striving to do things better. Dr Elliott hopes this case may help empower them to reform child protection, leading to “change for the sake of everyone within the Church, but particularly for those who are vulnerable, and those who have suffered harm”.

"UK disorder: What's Elon Musk's game? - BBC News BBC Homepage Skip to content Accessibility Help Your account Notifications Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds Bitesize More menu More menu Search BBC Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds Bitesize CBBC CBeebies Food Close menu BBC News Menu Home InDepth Israel-Gaza war US election Cost of Living War in Ukraine Climate UK World Business More Politics Culture Tech Science Health Family & Education In Pictures Newsbeat BBC Verify Disability InDepth What is Elon Musk's game plan? Published 7 August 2024 Marianna Spring Disinformation and social media correspondent X can feel like two parallel universes at times. There’s the version where the president of the United States chooses the platform to announce he won’t be running for re-election. That’s the one where the worldwide authority on a particular subject uses X to offer their expert take on unfolding events. And then there’s the version where false claims, hate and conspiracy theories, including many posts relating to the recent riots and protests across the UK, are recommended to millions who have made absolutely no attempt to seek them out. At the centre of it all is X’s owner Elon Musk, one of the world’s richest people. But this isn’t just a story about the monetisation strategy and algorithms employed by X under his tenure and how they are boosting divisive content. It is increasingly also a story about how Mr Musk himself is choosing to wade in, overtly, to opine on unrest in the UK. And nobody is quite sure what his game plan is. Stirring the pot Mr Musk bought what was then called Twitter in 2022. In November 2023, the site reinstated the account of the previously banned far-right activist and convicted criminal, Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, known as Tommy Robinson. Then this week, Mr Musk responded to a post from Yaxley-Lennon with two exclamation marks - in other words, stirring the pot. Yaxley-Lennon had taken aim at UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer for his words after riots broke out following the murder of three girls in Southport. Yaxley-Lennon had accused the Prime Minister of labelling everyone upset about the murders as “thugs”. Mr Starmer’s speech had specifically referred to thugs as being those throwing bricks at police officers. Yaxley-Lennon had also been critical of the prime minister’s comments about increasing policing powers in response to the riots. Mr Musk then later went on to suggest, in response to a video of rioting, that “civil war is inevitable”. The prime minister’s spokesperson said there was “no justification” for this claim. Mr Musk doubled down again - responding to the prime minister’s post about attacks on Muslim communities by asking: ""Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?” And Mr Musk repeated the remark in a tweet of his own, making allegations about violence from anti-racist and Muslim counter-protesters and accusing the police of a “one-sided” approach. It’s not as if X didn’t already contain plenty of content around events in Southport before Mr Musk’s interventions. False claims that the person responsible for the killings in Southport was a Muslim refugee who arrived in the UK by boat in 2023 spread like wildfire across X . They then spilled out on to other social media platforms and were also posted on some Telegram channels - but much of the most frenzied, amplified conversation was happening on X. The claims were shared by pseudo-news accounts, profiles with a track record of promoting evidence-free conspiracy theories about everything from the pandemic and vaccines to wars - and then also by prominent political commentators, politicians and influencers. The profiles reaching the most users with these ideas had often purchased blue ticks meaning their posts were granted more prominence on the platform. Mr Musk, with his own blue tick and 193 million followers, has been interacting with some profiles sharing divisive content and, in doing so, amplifying their message. 'Radicalising himself' There’s not currently a definitive answer as to what is driving Mr Musk. His presence as an active player on his own platform is certainly keeping X talked about. For all the furore around his ownership of X, last month the site said it had 251 million global daily active users in the second quarter of this year, an increase of 1.6% from the same period of the previous year. Of course, this can be attributed to a range of factors - like what’s happening in the world. While these figures represented a drop in growth, X is still a focal point for digital conversations. For all the warnings that X would cease to exist under Elon Musk, a variety of different users are continuing to post - including many world leaders and prominent political figures of all stripes. It may also have something to do with Mr Musk’s views on threats of regulation - and in the UK specifically, the Online Safety Act, which was passed under the previous government. When this comes into full effect in 2025 it will require social media firms to remove illegal content, including where it is ""racially or religiously aggravated"". Mr Musk has repeatedly been vocal about his concerns that attempts by governments to regulate social media sites - like his own - risk infringing freedom of speech. Others wonder if he has simply spent too much time on X. Sander van der Linden, a professor of social psychology at the University of Cambridge, has suggested , external that Mr Musk may be “radicalising himself on his own platform”. Of course, the reasons for the protests and riots in the UK clearly extend far beyond social media. It’s also the case that the Twitter of old, the pre-Musk version, was far from perfect. There were accusations of bias and suggestions its moderation policies curbed freedom of expression for particular types of accounts. It also had trolls aplenty. But on paper, its policies and approach were different - and, simply from analysing my own feed before and after the takeover, it was different. Straight after the takeover, Mr Musk stated the importance of fairness to all sides - including in terms of what then-Twitter allowed to be shared on the site. He has made clear that freedom of expression is a central priority at X - and as a private citizen, like any user, he’s entitled to share his opinion about politics or other topics.

Published 3 August The junior doctors' strikes may be over. But is trouble ahead? Published 2 August It is a recent development on Mr Musk’s part, though, to decide so clearly to back specific political positions and candidates. Take, for example, the way he endorsed Donald Trump after the assassination attempt, or the content he shares that is critical of Trump’s opponent Kamala Harris. He’s shared some posts that are very hostile to some liberal views. Now he has decided to voice opinions on some of the most sensitive issues in British life, too. What has evolved is a complex dynamic. As owner, Elon Musk oversees decisions made by X that have affected what content is permitted and actively recommended to users. At the same time, his account is thought to be the world’s most followed and itself plays a significant role in shaping the tone of some of X’s most promoted and contentious content. I’ve repeatedly approached the social media company in relation to the rioting in the UK, including multiple interview requests for Mr Musk. I even posted on X asking him. He has not responded to any of my interview requests. Mr Musk has highlighted his concerns that the media doesn’t hold power to account any more. And yet most of the time, when I want to ask questions of both him and of X - there is no response from the social media company. X continues to share in its publicly available guidelines that its priority is protecting and defending the user’s voice. So instead, I have to settle with imagining what I’d say to him if he finally did agree to speak. I think one of the first things I’d ask would be: “What’s your game plan?” It’s a question only he can answer.

Media caption, Director-general Tim Davie says he can’t see Huw Edwards working at the BBC again Noor Nanji Culture reporter @NoorNanji Reporting from Royal Television Society London Convention Published 4 hours ago The BBC’s director general Tim Davie said he can’t see Huw Edwards working at the corporation again. “This man has just been convicted of appalling crimes and it’s pretty straightforward in my mind, I can’t see him working here again,” he told BBC presenter Amol Rajan, at the Royal Television Society London Convention. On Monday, disgraced BBC News presenter Edwards was given a six-month prison sentence, suspended for two years , after he admitted charges of making indecent images of children. Mr Davie said ""for obvious reasons,"" the former presenter was unlikely to come back to the organsation. Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Huw Edwards arriving at Westminster Magistrates Court on Monday Four key takeaways from Huw Edwards' sentencing The court was told on Monday that Edwards received more than 40 images over several months from a convicted sex offender – including some showing a victim aged between seven and nine. Until last year, he was the BBC's most senior news presenter and often fronted coverage of major national events. Mr Davie said there was ""shock"" and ""a lot of upset” within the BBC over Edwards, adding that people across the organisation feel “deeply, deeply let down”. But he insisted it wasn’t about the BBC, but rather, about the victims and their families. Edwards was the BBC's highest-paid journalist, receiving between £475,000 and £479,999 between April 2023 and April 2024. The BBC has asked him to return the £200,000 he earned between his arrest last November and his resignation this April. The whole issue of pay did not come up in court on Monday. Addressing the matter, Mr Davie said discussions were ongoing about getting the salary back. “We want the money back… we’ve asked for it back,” he said. “There’s discussion between legal teams, that’s as far as I can go.” Image caption, Tim Davie: ""I’m not seeing a scenario in which any Huw Edwards material is used in day-to-day programming"" Watch on BBC iPlayer Huw Edwards: Fall from Grace Attribution iPlayer Mr Davie was also asked about a disciplinary process the BBC launched into Edwards after the Sun claims last year. That report, including details of other allegations made about him, has never been published, leading to accusations of a lack of transparency. ""My instincts are always about being fair, transparent, as much as we can,"" Mr Davie said. ""But there is something that if you have made an allegation as a disciplinary process, that is not a public matter."" Mr Davie insisted that anyone who came forward was ""taken seriously, they were listened to”. He also said the BBC board needs to “sign off” a review into workplace culture which was launched following the Huw Edwards allegations. The director general was also asked about whether Edwards will be removed from the BBC archives. “We never completely ban and rip someone out of the archive,” he said. But he added: “I’m not seeing a scenario in which any Huw Edwards material is used in day-to-day programming.” Huw Edwards scandal: Shock, anger and damage limitation in the BBC Published 2 days ago Timeline: How the Huw Edwards scandal unfolded Published 1 day ago Huw Edwards has not returned salary, BBC says Published 7 days ago Image source, Metropolitan Police Image caption, Former BBC newsreader Huw Edwards, seen in a custody photograph In July , Edwards pleaded guilty to three counts of making indecent images of children.

The judge sentencing him remarked that the former broadcaster's ""long-earned reputation"" was ""in tatters"". After the sentencing, a BBC spokesperson said the corporation was ""appalled"" by Edwards' crimes. ""He has betrayed not just the BBC, but audiences who put their trust in him.” Edwards will be placed on the sex offenders' register for seven years. He was also told to attend a sex offender treatment programme. Strictly controversy On a totally separate matter, Mr Davie was asked about the investigation into Amanda Abbington’s complaint about her former Strictly dance partner Giovanni Pernice. He didn't give a date for when it would be published, but insisted: “We’re pretty close to the end of that work.” He was asked whether it would’ve been useful to publish it ahead of the new series starting. “Many things in life would be useful, but we have to do the process,” he said. In June, it was confirmed that Pernice would not return for the new series. It comes after Abbington made allegations about how he treated her on the show. Pernice has denied any allegations of abusive or threatening behaviour.

Media caption, Davey calls for NHS investment to make it ‘winterproof' Joshua Nevett Political reporter, in Brighton @JoshuaNevett Published 1 hour ago Sir Ed Davey has said his party will offer a positive alternative to the Labour government’s “doom and gloom”, in his closing speech at the Liberal Democrat conference. Sir Ed - whose party has a record 72 MPs - said the country’s problems could not be solved with “the pessimism and defeatism we’re hearing from Labour”. He urged Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to be bolder in government and take action to prevent a “winter crisis” in the NHS. His party is calling for a new NHS taskforce with a £1.5bn fund to help hospitals and A&E services in England to cope with high patient demand in the winter. There was a party atmosphere in the conference hall as Sir Ed took to the stage. Most of the party's MPs were seated behind their leader, with some singing along to Abba's Take A Chance On Me. Sir Ed began by paying tribute to the MPs and praising the “sacrifices” made by his wife Emily, who appeared emotional as the audience applauded. The Lib Dems have been relentless this week in hammering home their core message on the need to invest more in the NHS. And Sir Ed made health and social care the main focus of his 40-minute speech. In a new policy announcement, he called on the government to set up a task force to help NHS Trusts plan their budgets more efficiently, instead of receiving emergency funding from the government at the last minute. “The government could and should make this year the last winter crisis in our NHS,” Sir Ed said. “So I urge Labour: do not make the same mistakes the Conservative Party did. “Be more positive. Act now. Show the ambition and urgency this moment demands - and save our NHS now.” Lib Dems: Housing pits Nimbys against Yimbys Published 6 hours ago Soldier, sailor, filmmaker - meet the new Lib Dem MPs Published 7 hours ago Rich should pay more inheritance tax, says Ed Davey Published 2 hours ago Sir Ed has been keen to position his party as “constructive opposition” to the Labour government. In his speech, he vowed to ""scrutinise"" Labour's plans carefully and ""oppose them if we think they’ve got it wrong"". But he also sought to distance himself from Sir Keir's message that ""things will get worse"" before they get better, with “painful” choices to come in the October budget. The Lib Dem leader said he wanted to ""cut through the government’s doom and gloom with our ambition for our country"". The Lib Dems opposed the Labour government’s decision to withdraw the winter fuel allowance from millions of pensions, in a Commons vote last week. But the Lib Dems have not toned down their hostility towards Conservatives, who lost 60 seats to them at the election. The Lib Dems say there are 57 constituencies where they need fewer than 10,000 votes to win and most of them are held by the Conservatives. In his speech, Sir Ed said it was his party’s job to “consign the Conservative Party to the history books”. He said they have chances to “finish the job” in county council elections next May, and “across the country in the years to come”. In a personal section of the speech, Sir Ed spoke about looking after his mum when she had cancer, and his son John, who has a neurological condition and learning difficulties. He said “we won’t save the NHS, if we don’t sort out care” and urged the prime minister to work him with on this issue. While the speech mainly focused on the NHS, it did include an endorsement of US Vice-President Kamala Harris’s candidacy for the presidency. It received one of the loudest rounds of applause. “With the looming spectre of a second Trump presidency,” Sir Ed said. “How I hope and pray to see Kamala Harris defeat him this November.” His speech drew the clearest dividing lines with Labour yet, and signalled the party’s direction of travel in this Parliament. In his closing remarks, Sir Ed said: “Let’s offer real hope. Let’s build a brighter future. And let’s keep on winning, so we can make it happen.” Related topics Liberal Democrats Ed Davey Top stories Hezbollah says exploding pagers kill three and injure many in Lebanon Published 22 minutes ago 'I am a rapist' admits man accused of drugging and abusing wife for 10 years Published 2 hours ago Live .

Carol Hunt, 61, Hannah Hunt, 28, and Louise Hunt, 25, were found fatally injured in Bushey, Hertfordshire, on 9 July. Kyle Clifford, 26, from Enfield, north London, was arrested after being found injured in a cemetery near his home on 10 July, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard. The defendant, who was also charged with false imprisonment and two counts of possession of offensive weapons, was remanded in custody after an appearance at the Royal Courts of Justice, London. The victims were the wife and daughters of BBC racing commentator John Hunt. Police had previously been unable to interview Mr Clifford while he received treatment in hospital, where he remained under arrest. Image source, PA Media Image caption, Kyle Clifford appeared Westminster Magistrates' Court and the Royal Courts of Justice via video link A brief court hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Tuesday morning was told the weapons Mr Clifford was accused of having at the Hunt family home were an MX-405 compact crossbow and a 10in (25cm) ""butcher's knife"". Police and the ambulance service had been called to the property by Hannah Hunt, prosecutor David Burns said. ""Police attended the property - they found the front door was open,"" Mr Burns said. The court heard that Louise had been found tied up. She had been shot with a crossbow. Hannah Hunt had also been shot with a crossbow and their mother Carol had been stabbed with a knife and suffered multiple injuries, the court was told. ""They found Hannah Hunt lying in the doorway. She had been shot by a crossbow in the chest,"" Mr Burns said. He added that Carol Hunt had suffered ""multiple"" knife wounds.

District Judge Paul Goldspring remanded him in custody ahead of the hearing at the High Court on Tuesday afternoon. Mr Clifford later appeared in front of High Court judge Mr Justice Johnson, again via video link. No trial date was set because inquiries were being made about a suitable court for him to be tried in as a wheelchair user. In a previous statement, Mr Hunt and surviving daughter Amy said their devastation at the killings ""cannot be put into words"". A fundraiser set up to support them saw more than £120,000 in donations pledged. Det Ch Insp Nick Gardner, of Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: ""We have been working hard to gather as much evidence as possible and establish the full circumstances of what happened that day. ""Although it has taken some time to reach this stage, we can now move forward with the judicial process and seek justice for their family.""

Speaking in a livestream on social media platform X, the Republican presidential candidate said he and a friend were ""grabbed"" by agents and bundled into golf carts as gunfire rang out. Secret Service personnel several hundred metres away had spotted the barrel of a rifle poking out of foliage. After opening fire, agents pursued the suspect, who dropped his weapon and drove away, but was later arrested on a highway. The suspect, 58-year-old Ryan Routh, did not fire any shots himself, the Secret Service has said. Gunman lurked for hours before Trump's last-minute game of golf What do we know about the suspect, Ryan Routh? Routh appeared briefly in a Florida court on Monday to face federal gun possession charges, as investigations by the FBI continue. The FBI has said it is investigating the incident as ""an attempted assassination"" against Trump but did not formally charge Routh with related charges. Florida prosecutors are also investigating the case with the possibility of adding additional, more severe, charges. ""I think this is an offence that should merit life in prison,"" Florida Governor Ron Desantis said at a press briefing on Tuesday, announcing the state's investigation. ""I think it's really important for the people of Florida, but also for our country, that we pursue the most serious charges that are on the books to hold this guy accountable."" Later on Tuesday, Trump is due to make his first in-person appearance since the incident at a ""town hall"" in Flint, Michigan, a crucial swing state where votes will help decide the presidential election. His campaign schedule will not change, according to a source cited by the Reuters news agency. This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Media caption, Ros Atkins examines how gunman neared Trump at golf course In his account, Trump recalled that he and friend Steve Witkoff ""heard shots being fired in the air, I guess probably four or five"" as Secret Service agents on the course's next hole spotted the rifle and fired at the suspect. The agents with Trump ""knew immediately it was bullets, and they grabbed me"", he said. ""We got into the carts and we moved along pretty, pretty good. I was with an agent, and the agent did a fantastic job,"" he said during the X Spaces event. In comments to the Washington Post, he insisted that the incident, as well as an attempt on his life during a rally in Pennsylvania on 13 July, had not affected him. ""But people ask me that question a lot, and I try not to think about it,"" he said. In a rare show of political unity, Trump also commended President Joe Biden for a ""very nice"" phone call after the apparent assassination attempt. The White House said Biden expressed his relief that Trump was safe. Trump sought to blame the apparent attempt on ""inflammatory language"" from Democratic political rivals. Authorities have not yet disclosed a potential motive for Routh, who has a history of legal problems and varied political affiliations. How much security does Donald Trump get? Secret Service 'needs more help', Biden says Secret Service 'aware' of Elon Musk post about Harris, Biden Sunday's events came weeks after Trump was injured by a 20-year-old gunman who shot at him at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July. The incident, which left a rally attendee dead, led to the resignation of the Security Service's director Kimberly Cheatle, and the beefing-up of Trump's security detail. In Monday's remarks to the Washington Post, Trump said agents had taken a different approach during the second incident, choosing to evacuate him from the area with ""rather quick golf carts"", rather than jumping on him. The second apparent attempt on Trump's life raised fresh questions from across the political spectrum about whether he is receiving enough protection. Biden has acknowledged that the agency ""needs more help"". The Secret Service's acting head, Ronald Rowe, joined Trump in praising the actions of individual agents, and defended the level of security provided to the Republican. In a news conference on Monday, he stressed that Trump had the ""highest levels of protection"" and that the agency's plan worked as it should have done on Sunday. Mr Rowe also said the ex-president's trip to the golf course was not on his public schedule. This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Image source, Getty Images Jake Horton & Lucy Gilder BBC Verify Published 16 September 2024 Updated 6 hours ago The Biden administration has asked Congress for special permission to increase spending on the Secret Service, warning that without it, the service would have ""insufficient resources"" to enhance its protective operations. The request follows what authorities have said was a second apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump, with further questions being asked about Secret Service protection of the former president and Republican presidential candidate. What security is Trump entitled to? We don’t know the exact number of agents who are assigned to the former president, but according to Ronald Kessler, an author who specialises in the Secret Service, about 80 would be assigned to Trump at any one time. About 300 agents are assigned to the sitting president and vice-president, compared to the 90 to 100 who protect a former president, Mr Kessler said. These totals include all staff, which means Trump would not have that many agents with him in every instance. “The shift detail is always the same - this is the close protection officers near the president - but then there’s counter-sniper teams, counter-assault teams, counter-surveillance teams,” said Michael Matranga, who worked at the Secret Service for 12 years under Barack Obama. On a day-to-day basis, former presidents wouldn’t have those additional teams, but Trump does, according to Mr Matranga. “More can still be done. It would be good to have dogs sweeping bushes or an emergency response team scanning the area,” he said. “But people need to understand that the Secret Service need to find a balance where the president can engage with constituents or enjoy a round of golf. They can’t just keep him in a bulletproof box,” Mr Matranga added. Former Secret Service agent Jason Russell told the BBC that the service was in charge of the area in the immediate vicinity of the former president. But he added that local law enforcement would be in charge of the outer perimeter of a public space, like the golf course. How has Trump's security changed? The Secret Service ramped up security before the first assassination attempt after receiving intelligence of an Iranian plot to kill Trump , external - and has further increased its staffing since then. During a hearing following the Pennsylvania attempt, the acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe told lawmakers they were expanding the use of drones to check areas, improving communication and increasing the number of security agents. BBC Verify has asked the Secret Service how many more agents were given to Trump’s security detail following the first assassination attempt but the agency has not yet responded. Mr Russell said that he had noticed “the number of agents and the number of assets that has been given to former president Trump has certainly increased”. “Once he became the nominee obviously that protection goes up to another level, where you start to get additional assets… but certainly not the level a sitting president or vice-president would have,” he added. The Washington Post has reported , external that senior officials at the Secret Service repeatedly rejected requests for additional protection from Trump’s security team in the two years leading up to the attempt on his life in July. Although the agency initially denied that such requests were made, it later acknowledged that some requests from Trump's security detail may have been rejected. On Monday, the acting head of the Secret Service, Ronald Rowe, said security around Mr Trump's home was now as intense as when he was president. He said he was being provided with the ""highest level"" of security. This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Media caption, Ros Atkins examines how gunman neared Trump at golf course What is the Secret Service budget and staffing? The Secret Service had a total budget of $3.1bn in the 2024 financial year , external . This was 9% higher than the previous year’s budget. Just over $1bn of this was allocated to “Protection of Persons and Facilities”. The service has around 8,000 staff in total , external , including special agents, administrative and technical personnel. Nearly half (3,671) work full-time in Protective Operations. A decade ago, there were 4,027 people assigned to protect the president and other senior officials, according to NBC News. , external “The whole budget of the Secret Service is about the same as one stealth bomber,” Mr Kessler said. “The whole agency is suffering with a lack of money and staff,” he added. As well as the government's request to increase spending in the coming weeks, the Secret Service has separately told Congress that it needs more resources to carry out its duties. What do we know about suspect Ryan Wesley Routh? Analysis: Political violence becomes America's new norm What we know about the incident so far Full story: Suspect held and Trump rushed to safety Questions about Trump’s schedule “The biggest question I have is not about the Secret Service’s reaction, but how the suspect knew Trump was going to be on the golf course at that time,” Mr Matranga told us. It isn’t yet known how the suspect knew of Trump's whereabouts on Sunday. BBC Verify has been looking through Trump's recent posts on social media and he did not say that he would be playing golf at his West Palm Beach course at the time and date the assassination attempt took place. Following a rally in Las Vegas on Friday, Trump’s campaign schedule , external mentions no other events until a town hall speech in Michigan on 17 September. CNN has also quoted from sources , external who claim Trump’s visit to the golf course was a last-minute addition to his schedule. However, it would be reasonable to assume Trump could be in Mar-a-Lago at the weekend, given how frequently he travels there. He also posted on X , external (on 12 September) that he would be hosting a ""State of Crypto Address"" on the evening of 16 September from Mar-a-Lago. Trump has often been filmed and photographed with members of the public at his golf course, such as in this Instagram post from July 2024 , external .

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Media caption, Watch: Ros Atkins on…the apparent Trump assassination attempt Ann Butler BBC News Mike Wendling BBC News @mwendling Published 16 September 2024 The suspect in an apparent assassination attempt against Donald Trump is a staunch supporter of Ukraine who was rejected by the country's armed forces and failed to make much of a contribution to the war effort. Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, who appeared in court on Monday, is from North Carolina and spent most of his life there, but most recently lived in Hawaii. He voted for Trump in 2016 but later turned against him, and made statements of support and contributions to other politicians. Here are some of the other things we know about him. What did Routh do? He is suspected of going to the Trump International Golf Course in Florida on Sunday, armed with an SKS-style rifle. The FBI recovered the weapon and scope, two backpacks and a GoPro camera from an area heavy with bush cover. Law enforcement allege that Routh fled the area when a Secret Service agent fired in his direction after spotting a rifle barrel poking out of the bushes. He is not believed to have fired his own weapon during the incident, and is not believed to have had a clear line of sight to Trump at any point. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said two officers spotted Routh's vehicle, a black Nissan, and followed it for 45 minutes. Routh was stopped on Interstate 95, a major highway, and arrested. He has been initially charged with federal firearms offences. The affidavit states that Routh's phone was in the ""vicinity"" of the covered area for 12 hours. The car, a Nissan SUV, was later determined to have number plates which belonged to a 2012 Ford which had been reported as stolen. Image source, Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office/Reuters Image caption, Police allege Routh left a weapon and kit What does Routh's social media show? BBC Verify found a number of social media profiles matching Routh's name. Routh repeatedly touted his work in encouraging foreign fighters to go to Ukraine to battle against Russia. However, most of his organising appears to have happened while he was in the US, not in Ukraine, where in 2022 he was rejected by the country's International Legion due to his lack of combat experience. The FBI is still investigating his links to Ukraine and has sent out multiple requests to companies for returns on his phone and social media accounts. There are also pro-Palestinian, pro-Taiwan and anti-China messages on his profile, including allegations about Chinese ""biological warfare"" and references to the Covid-19 virus as an ""attack"". On an X post from 2020, Routh suggested he voted for Trump in 2016 but became disillusioned, writing: ""I will be glad when you [are] gone."" Routh also posted online urging President Joe Biden and Vice-President Harris to meet victims of the attempt on Trump's life in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July. Image source, Martin County Sheriff's Office Image caption, Routh, in a photo released by Martin County Sheriff's Office What are his political affiliations? Routh was registered as an unaffiliated voter in North Carolina, but appears to have voted in the most recent Democratic primary in March, according to state records. In 2019 and 2020, he gave a number of small donations totalling around $140 (£106) to ActBlue, a Democratic fundraising organisation, according to online federal elections records. An Associated Press photo of a truck outside Routh's Hawaii home displayed a Biden-Harris campaign sticker on the back. In the past Routh also backed candidates such as Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat who has since left the party and swung behind Trump, and also declared his support for former Republican presidential candidates Vivek Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley. What was Routh doing in Ukraine? Routh described himself as a ""volunteer co-ordinator"" and his ambitions to join combat were not realised. The International Legion told the BBC that Routh had ""never been part of, associated with, or linked"" with the legion ... in any capacity"". A volunteer for the legion described Routh to the BBC as a chaotic presence who kept trying to ""sneak around"" officials and was ""doing more harm than good"". The volunteer said that Routh was in Ukraine in April 2022. ""He was not part of any unit and his activities were essentially causing chaos,"" the volunteer said. ""He was also trying to pose as some sort of official entity for all volunteers, which, again, he was not,"" she said. Routh told The New York Times in 2023 that he wanted to recruit Afghan soldiers who had fled the Taliban. One Facebook post from July of this year read: ""Soldiers, please do not call me. We are still trying to get Ukraine to accept Afghan soldiers and hope to have some answers in the coming months... please have patience."" In a book self-published in February 2023, Routh grumbled about how his efforts were received in Ukraine. ""I have yet to see... the smallest amount of appreciation or respect,"" he wrote. In the book, Routh said he spent five months in Ukraine and worked on various projects including a drone-building programme. He claims his efforts ended in failure or were shut down by the authorities. The book also contains a passage where he encourages Iranian officials, that they were ""free to assassinate Trump"". Trump thanks Secret Service - but is he protected enough? Analysis: Political violence becomes America's new norm - but is still shocking What we know about the attack Does Routh have a criminal record? Records show Routh’s legal issues go back to the 1990s, including a variety of felonies and misdemeanours, including numerous charges for stolen goods. He was charged and convicted of numerous felony offences in Guilford County in North Carolina between 2002 and 2010, according to online records. In 2002, he was charged for possession of a fully automatic machine gun, which was referred to in court filings as a ""weapon of mass destruction"". A local newspaper report from the time , external noted that he barricaded himself in a business and had a three-hour stand-off with police officers in the town of Greensboro before being taken into custody. In another incident, records show him being charged with misdemeanours including a hit-and-run, resisting arrest, and a concealed weapons violation. His alleged offences also include driving with a revoked licence and possession of stolen property. In 2019, the FBI also received a tip that Routh was a felon in possession of a firearm. The unverified tip was passed on to local law enforcement in Honolulu. Former neighbour Kim Mungo describes Routh as a ""sweetheart"" and said federal agents once raided Routh's property. She alleged that he used to keep ""loads of stolen property and stuff"" at his home, and said she saw Routh and his family firing guns in the open. Does Routh have any family? Routh's eldest son, Oran, described his father as ""a loving and caring father, and honest hardworking man"". He told CNN: ""I don't know what's happened in Florida, and I hope things have just been blown out of proportion, because from the little I've heard it doesn’t sound like the man I know to do anything crazy, much less violent."" Friends and family members are being sought for interviews by the FBI, including in North Carolina and Hawaii. What happens next?

Media caption, Bodycam footage shows arrest of suspected Trump gunman Routh appeared in front of a judge on Monday at the Palm Beach County court near Mar-a-Lago, charged with firearms offences. The charges against him did not include any references to trying to kill Trump, though the FBI has said it is investigating Sunday's incident as an assassination attempt. Law enforcement stated after the court appearance that the suspect did not fire a weapon and did not have a line of sight on Trump. Secret Service and Homeland Security agents have searched Routh's former home in Greensboro, North Carolina. A hearing is scheduled for next Monday to determine whether he should remain in custody. Prosecutors say he is a flight risk and a danger to the community.

"What time is the supermoon lunar eclipse? - BBC Weather BBC Homepage Skip to content Accessibility Help Your account Notifications Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds Bitesize More menu More menu Search BBC Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds Bitesize CBBC CBeebies Food Close menu BBC Weather Rare supermoon partial eclipse to grace UK night sky Image source, EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock Simon King Lead Weather Presenter @SimonOKing Published 7 hours ago There will be a partial eclipse of the supermoon visible across the United Kingdom on Tuesday night. This month's full moon - known as the Harvest moon - also happens to be the second of four ""supermoons"" this year. Full supermoons occur when the orbit of the moon is at perigee - the closest point to Earth in its orbit, which makes the Moon appear bigger and brighter in the night sky. Most areas should get a good view tonight, although cloud is expected to develop for some across England and eastern Wales as the night goes on. Image caption, The forecast suggests most of the UK should get a chance of seeing the partial eclipse What time is the lunar eclipse? The full harvest supermoon will rise on Tuesday evening at around 7.15pm BST. At approximately 1:40am on Wednesday morning, a small shadow created by Earth will appear in the top right corner of the moon as the eclipse starts. There are two types of shadow caused by Earth. The lighter one, called the penumbra, will not have too much effect but the umbra, the inner and darker shadow, will darken the Moon. The partial eclipse will reach its maximum at 3.44am. But do not expect there to be a big shadow visible on the supermoon as only around 4% of the Moon's disc will be covered in darkness by the umbra shadow. Where there are clear skies, even though it is a small partial eclipse, you will still be able to see it without the need for a telescope or binoculars. Why is this lunar eclipse so special? Full moons happen every month but supermoons are less common - even though this will be the second of four this year. You may remember the blue supermoon only last month . Partial lunar eclipses also do not happen very often. The next one is in August 2026, which will be special as around 96% of the Moon will be in shadow. Therefore, to have a partial eclipse of a full moon, which happens to be a supermoon, is rare. What does 'harvest moon' mean? Full moons are given a name every month linked to aspects of life in the month which they occur. The harvest moon is the name given to the full moon that occurs nearest to the autumn equinox, which this year occurs on 22 September. A supermoon occurs when the Moon is at its closest point to the Earth. This is known as the lunar perigee. A full moon during perigee will appear 14% larger and 30% brighter than when it is furthest away from Earth. October's hunter moon and November's beaver moon will also be supermoons this year.

But on Tuesday during the show’s prime-time season premiere, there will be a twist, when convicted fraudster Anna Delvey - real name Anna Sorokin - takes to the floor wearing a bejewelled ankle monitor. In a press release, Disney-owned ABC called Sorokin “an artist, fashion icon and infamous NYC socialite”, as well as “a notorious ankle bracelet fashionista”. She will be joining a cast that includes an NBA veteran, various reality-TV stars, and two Olympians, for the latest edition of the US spin-off from the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing format. Critics accused the channel of glamorising her past crimes. The New York Post called it a “new low for pop culture”. Some have also questioned how she has right to live and work in the US, as a German-Russian citizen. Sorokin’s electronic ankle monitor is not for her original 2019 convictions, which came after she travelled the world masquerading as a European heiress, conning banks, lawyers and a private jet company out of more than $200,000 (£150,000). Instead, the ankle monitor is the result of a years-long immigration battle in the US, where she is fighting deportation. Image source, Getty Images Image caption, While on bail pending immigration charges, Anna Sorokin has attended New York Fashion Week, appeared in Vogue and started her own podcast Debates online are raging over this new chapter of infamy. Some appear to admire her endless ambition, as if she represents some sort of warped American Dream. Others have slammed her continued self-promotion and seeming lack of remorse as shameless. During a heated discussion on The View talk show, Whoopi Goldberg said her ability to appear on Dancing with the Stars, despite facing immigration charges, is an example of a “two-tier immigration system” that favours the wealthy or connected. Others have said it's hardly surprising to see her convictions being overlooked in a country where a felon is running for president. Sorokin first gained notoriety when New York Magazine published an investigation into her misdeeds in 2018. Her scams were later explored in the Netflix series Inventing Anna and BBC podcast Fake Heiress. It was the audacity that intrigued people. She had worked her way into elite circles in New York City in a ruse that lasted for years. Her goal was to secure a $22m loan to build an arts foundation in her own name. While living under the heiress persona, she forged bank statements, ran up large bills at luxury hotels that she couldn’t afford, dashed out of restaurants without paying, bounced cheques, created fake emails from accountants, and let others pick up her tabs after extravagant spending. Small businesses and individuals were also affected. “She’s been a public figure for a long enough time that I don’t think people remember the details of what the crimes were – if ever they really knew them in the first place,” said Jessica Pressler, who wrote the first piece on her in New York Magazine, and became the inspiration for the fictionalised journalist character in Inventing Anna. “People don’t look that far past the surface,” she added, acknowledging this is what aided the original grift. “Dancing With the Stars… it’s a natural extension of the story.” Rise and fall Sorokin was arrested in 2017 while on the run in California and went on criminal trial in New York. In 2019, she was found guilty of eight theft-related charges, and sentenced to between four and 12 years. That was part one of her legal struggles. After serving almost four years, including time in the notorious Rikers Island jail, she was released in February 2021, and was expected to leave the US. But she didn’t go. Six weeks later – following a string of media appearances and having signed a paid TV deal with a German company – immigration authorities arrested her for overstaying her visa. More than three years on, she is still fighting deportation. She has served time back in jail and under house arrest. In 2022, she was scheduled to board a plane in New York to return to Germany. But her lawyer intervened and she did not fly. Litigation regarding her deportation was ongoing, they said. Her exact claims for asylum are unclear, but they are believed to relate to her Russian citizenship. She lived there in her early years but her family moved to Germany in her teens. When she was in New York in her 20s, she had a tourist visa. The race to secure the story of New York's 'fake heiress' Published 20 February 2021 Listen to the BBC's original podcast: Fake Heiress Attribution Sounds Fake heiress tells BBC: 'Crime pays, in a way' Published 10 March 2021 While under house arrest, Sorokin started her own podcast and did interviews with various media. (Vogue magazine filmed a tour of her apartment in the East Village; Vogue UK wrote a “What is Anna Delvey reading?” feature.) “Most of us would die of embarrassment at doing anything that she does,” said Pressler, describing how Sorokin stayed in a hotel for months without paying the bill and flew to Morocco with no money. “From staying in a hotel for months and not paying bills, to getting on a plane to Morocco with no money, no-one would do that. She does it with aplomb. I think on the whole any admiration people have for her is kind of limited to that.” “They aren’t going to do these things, they don’t think the things she’s done are good, but the ordinary person wishes they could have that belief in themselves.” John Sandweg - who served as the acting head of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) during Barack Obama's presidency - is her current immigration lawyer. He told the BBC that lengthy deportation cases are not uncommon in the United States, but this has been “fairly protracted”. “Her criminal case has also been on appeal for a long time and that has had an impact,” he added. He said her house arrest terms were “really restrictive”. “We challenged those. She was banned from social media. We argued that was unconstitutional,” he said. She wasn’t a flight risk or a danger to society, and she had kept to her parole conditions, he added. As a result of the challenge, her bond conditions were relaxed in August. She is now back on social media and she has been permitted to travel to Los Angeles for the filming of Dancing with the Stars. She also has a social security number. ICE confirmed to the BBC that she had received permission to travel. “Anna Sorokin’s conditions of release were amended by a Department of Justice immigration judge,” said the spokesperson. Sorokin had to pay rent while under house arrest, but this also caused dispute. Her landlord filed legal action, saying she had failed to pay three months’ rent. Court documents show he claimed Sorokin owed more than $12,000. The case was eventually resolved and she moved out. Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Anna Sorokin with her Dancing with the Stars dance partner Ezra Sosa Sorokin has employed plenty of lawyers in recent years. The funding is believed to have come from media deals and sales of her prison artwork. Netflix controversially paid Sorokin $320,000 (£230,000) for her life story for its Inventing Anna series. After a state intervention, she was legally obliged to use some of that money to pay back the victims of her theft. But there was some money left over to pay for her lawyer in the original trial. Netflix is facing a defamation trial, sparked by the series. The case was brought by Sorokin’s one-time friend Rachel Williams, who was portrayed in the show. Williams wrote a book My Friend Anna about their short-lived friendship and how it fell apart after she was left to foot a $62,000 bill at a luxury resort in Morocco. The lawsuit argues that Netflix used her real name and biographical details in its Inventing Anna series, but she was unfairly depicted as a ""vile and contemptible person"". Netflix, in an attempt to dismiss the lawsuit, said their interpretation of Williams was open to “literary licence” and protected by the First Amendment, according to Variety magazine. Sorokin is not involved in that case, although she has been subpoenaed as a witness for the trial. Williams’ lawyer Alexander Rufus-Isaacs told the BBC that the case was expected to come to trial next year. He said Sorokin’s employment on Dancing with the Stars was “glamorising and minimising the crimes she committed, and minimising the impact on the people she hurt”. In court, Sorokin was found not guilty of the charge related to the Morocco trip. American Express eventually refunded Williams, but after she had suffered a long period of stress and anxiety, according to her book. While some have viewed Sorokin as an anti-establishment hero for infiltrating and embarrassing wealthy institutions, Williams did not see it that way. She previously told the BBC: “The system that Anna was seeking to undermine… she wasn’t doing it out of some altruistic nobility, she wanted to be a part of them.” In response to the recent backlash, Dancing with the Stars boss Conrad Green told Variety: “Yes, [Sorokin] had the issues she’s had, but we’ve had other people on the show who’ve had criminal issues in the past. She served her time. I think it’s perfectly valid for her to be on the show.” For more on the rise and fall of Anna Delvey, listen to the BBC's podcast Fake Heiress.

"Four key takeaways from Huw Edwards' sentencing - BBC News BBC Homepage Skip to content Accessibility Help Your account Notifications Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds Bitesize More menu More menu Search BBC Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds Bitesize CBBC CBeebies Food Close menu BBC News Menu Home InDepth Israel-Gaza war US election Cost of Living War in Ukraine Climate UK World Business More Politics Culture Tech Science Health Family & Education In Pictures Newsbeat BBC Verify Disability Culture Four key takeaways from Huw Edwards' sentencing Image source, Julia Quenzler Dominic Casciani Home and Legal Correspondent @BBCDomC Published 16 September 2024 Former BBC News presenter Huw Edwards has been given a suspended prison term after he admitted making indecent images of children. Westminster Magistrates' Court heard he received more than 40 images over several months from convicted sex offender Alex Williams. Here are four things we learned from the sentencing hearing. Online exchanges lasted about four years When Huw Edwards pleaded guilty in July, we knew that he had communicated with Alex Williams, the man who supplied the indecent images, from at the very least December 2020. That’s when Williams, convicted earlier this year, sent Edwards the first images that count as “indecent”, the archaic legalese for depictions of abuse. The online relationship in fact began two years before that and it was of a sexual nature. According to the evidence, it coincided with a period when Edwards was struggling with both his mental health and sexual identity. Williams said he had contacted Edwards because he was hoping to get a response. He did - and the online relationship lasted four years on and off - and Edwards began receiving legal pornographic images and a smaller number of illegal abuse images. Prosecutor Ian Hope told the sentencing hearing they met once in person, and there was evidence of a solitary video-call too. The only evidence of this relationship comes from Williams’s phone as the handset used by Edwards at the time was not found. Payments - but not for images The bulk of the 377 images sent by Williams were legal pornography featuring young adult men. So they were not part of the prosecution. But 41 of them depicted children. That is the material that Edwards admitted ""making"" - the legal term for a phone or computer receiving the data for an image or video and therefore creating the file in its memory. Edwards would have been aware of what he was being sent, because he discussed it with Williams. “In December 2020 Alex Williams said that he had ‘a file of vids and pics for you of someone special’,” prosecutor Ian Hope told the court. “Mr Edwards immediately queried who the subject was and was then sent three images of seemingly the same person.” That person was aged between 14 and 16 and the images were “Category C” in the table of severity of abuse, the lowest of the three tiers. Williams then asked Edwards whether he wanted the “full file”. Edwards responded: “Yes xxx...” Williams then sent further and more severe images of abuse and a final video file of a Category A incident involving abuse of a boy aged between 13 and 15. Edwards and Williams wished each other a Happy Christmas. When Williams said he had “hot” files that were big to send, Edwards recommended Dropbox. In time, the former newsreader referred to some of the material as “amazing” but it is not clear whether that meant the legal or illegal images. We heard in court that Edwards had paid Williams. But this was not taken by the sentencing chief magistrate to mean that he had been paid for the indecent images. It was more a case of “thank you” for whatever was going on between them - in effect gifts. For instance, Williams asked for “a Christmas gift after all the hot videos”. Edwards sent him £200 for some Nike Air Force 1 trainers. And in total, Williams received between £1,000 and £1,500, which helped pay his way at university. Watch: Huw Edwards: Fall from Grace Timeline: How the Huw Edwards scandal unfolded Shock, anger and damage limitation in the BBC This on and off exchange continued through to 2021. Edwards ultimately received seven files of the worst type of abuse. There’s no evidence as to what Edwards thought about those files - but a crucial part of the case shows that he did respond to questions Williams asked him about the subject matter. That shows that it was Williams who was leading the conversation about the nature of the images, rather than Edwards. “Is the stuff I’m sending too young for you?” asked Williams on 19 February 2021. Three days later Edwards replies: “Don’t send underage.” But when in August Williams offered Edwards more files, and said they involve people who were “yng”, the former newsreader said: “Go on.” This was the second of two videos featuring a child aged between seven and nine. Prosecutor Ian Hope said: “Alex Williams says the subject is ‘quite yng looking’ to which Mr Edwards responds it ‘can be deceptive’ and asks if he has ‘any more?’ Alex Williams says he has but he is not sure if Mr Edwards would like them as they are illegal. Mr Edwards says ‘Ah ok don’t’.” Image source, PA Media Mental health battles The evidence in the case shows that Edwards had been struggling with mental ill health for many years and had fragile self-esteem. The court heard he had what appears to have been unresolved feelings about his sexuality dating back to 1994. Confusion about sexuality is not the same as an interest in images of child abuse - far from it. So what led to him receiving the images from Williams, even if he later regretted it? A forensic psychotherapist wrote in a report for the court that the people Edwards was meeting via social media helped boost his low mood - but then created a “perfect storm” leading to the offending. That decision making, the court heard, was linked to Edwards’ mental ill health and the wider picture of his complex character. One expert who analysed Edwards said he grew up in a puritanical but hypocritical environment with a father described in court as “monstrous”. Edwards entered adulthood feeling inferior - and that was compounded, the expert concluded, by working in an organisation that he had perceived as being full of Oxford graduates (Note to readers: it isn’t). In time he developed clinical depression leading to therapy at times - but his situation worsened from 2018 - and then more so during the first awful year of the pandemic, which coincides with the majority of the offending. The conclusion of the experts was that Edwards was sufficiently unwell that it affected his decision-making - a situation exacerbated by alcohol, a heart problem and a breakdown of relationships within his own family. All of this could sound to some like a sob story - but the court accepted that there was evidence that Edwards’ mental health had improved - and therefore his understanding of his crimes - thanks to help. And that sign of improvement was a key factor in what the chief magistrate decided to do. Sentencing can be a very finely balanced act The burning question for many tonight is why was Huw Edwards not sent to prison? The simple answer is ... there is no simple and uniform solution for dealing with offenders. The offence he committed could in theory lead to 10 years in jail. But, in practice, detailed sentencing guidelines, developed over years of comparing varying cases, save that severe punishment for the worst of the worst people who are producing the images that Williams scooped up and went on to share. Edwards, by receiving them, was at the bottom of that chain of abuse. So his sentence was always going to be well short of that maximum 10 years - and, likely to be shorter than the 12 months suspended sentence given to Alex Williams in March. The guidelines say that for someone in Edwards' position, the starting point is a year in jail with a range of between six months and three years. Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring began his sentencing calculation with a year. He knocked three months off to take into account the mental health evidence and the fact that this was a first offence. This is absolutely standard procedure. He then discounted the sentence by a third, bringing it down to six months, to credit the earliest possible guilty plea. Again, this discount for an admission is a standard feature of sentencing law. It is an offer to focus an offender’s mind on pleading guilty early and accepting their crimes. It saves a huge amount of public money by not tying up the criminal justice system with a jury trial. And it means, if the offender is willing, they can get on with the long and hard process of rehabilitation as soon as possible. The next question was whether Edwards needed to be jailed to protect the public. The chief magistrate concluded not, because he accepted evidence that the offender before him had already understood the gravity of what he had done - and was responding to therapy. And so he moved down a notch from immediate jail to a suspended six month sentence. That means that if Edwards were to commit another offence in the next two years, he would be likely to go to jail immediately. But if he stays on the road to reform, he won't. The prosecution had argued that Edwards needed to be subject to restrictions on his liberties through a Sexual Harm Prevention Order. That would have allowed agencies to monitor or curtail his communications and movements - including knowing his entire internet history on every device he uses. The court heard that probation experts had used a ""predictor tool"" to estimate the likelihood of Edwards reoffending. It had found his risk of indirect internet-based offending - meaning viewing more images - to be medium. But his lawyers argued that risk was diminishing because he was on the mend and had shown genuine remorse. The chief magistrate said that it was not necessary to subject Edwards to the additional SHPO conditions, given the progress towards rehabilitation already underway. Edwards must complete a 40-day Sex Offender Treatment Programme and 25 rehabilitation sessions aimed at helping him to fix his mental health and use of alcohol. Even if all that is successful, there is a sting in the sentencing tail. For the next seven years Edwards will be on the sex offender register - meaning he has to keep the police informed of his whereabouts. It will be difficult for him to travel abroad on holiday and some countries may never let him in at all. He’s free from prison - but he is not free in the true sense of the word. His life choices will be watched on and off for years to come.

"Working from home boosts productivity, Jonathan Reynolds says - BBC News BBC Homepage Skip to content Accessibility Help Your account Notifications Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds Bitesize More menu More menu Search BBC Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds Bitesize CBBC CBeebies Food Close menu BBC News Menu Home InDepth Israel-Gaza war US election Cost of Living War in Ukraine Climate UK World Business More Politics Culture Tech Science Health Family & Education In Pictures Newsbeat BBC Verify Disability Right to WFH boosts productivity, Labour says Image source, Getty Images Suzanne Leigh BBC News UK Published 4 hours ago Comments Allowing flexible working and working from home creates a more productive, loyal workforce, the business secretary has said. In an interview with the Times , external , Jonathan Reynolds said employers ""need to judge people on outcomes and not a culture of presenteeism"". Labour is poised to unveil its Employment Rights Bill, which includes measures such as a right to ""disconnect"" outside working hours, a ban on zero-hours contracts and allowing workers to compress their contracted hours into fewer working days. Business groups have raised concerns about the plans, warning it could push up the cost of hiring staff and have the unintended consequence of ending overtime. However, Reynolds said Labour's plans to address workers' rights should not be alarming for business leaders. Since April, workers have had the right , external - introduced under the previous government - to ask for flexible working as soon as they start a job, but firms do not have to agree. Labour had promised to introduce legislation on workers' rights within 100 days of being elected, although Reynolds said this would not mean immediate changes to the law. The plans include a right to flexible working by ""default"" and the repeal of anti-strike legislation brought in under the Conservatives. Reynolds criticised one of his Tory predecessors, Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, who had said he wanted to end the culture of working from home in the civil service but also in wider industry. ""That's pretty bizarre given the economic position the country was in and the real business agenda that needs to be pursued,"" Reynolds said. The interview coincides with an announcement from Amazon that all staff will be expected to work in the office five days a week from January. The company said staff could still work from home in unusual circumstances, such as caring for a sick child or a house emergency, but chief executive Andy Jassy said ""our expectation is that people will be in the office"". Earlier this year, Morrisons scrapped four-day working weeks for its head office staff following feedback that in order to make it work, staff had to work some Saturdays. Asda also shelved a four-day week trial after staff complained that the longer shifts were too demanding. Prof Efpraxia Zamani, associate professor of information systems at Durham University Business School, said flexible working offered lots of benefits to women but there was a flip side. ""It gives you access to a wider range of possibilities for work. Let's say you are a woman living in a rural area, it means you can get jobs further away without having to travel. ""The flexibility of working from home means that you can do your job and also take care of other things. For example, unpaid carers, and the vast majority of unpaid carers are women, it means they can work from home, still carry out their caring responsibilities and remain in employment."" However, she warned: ""If a woman is working from home it is sort of expected that they will, alongside their work, be the one doing the housework or caring for children. The working day becomes very fragmented."" Prof Zamani said research also suggested working from home could have an impact on career progression. ""If the remote worker is not in the awareness of managers, it is easier to bypass them for promotion,"" she said. Image source, PA Media Image caption, Jonathan Reynolds said he benefited from being in the office alongside experienced colleagues when he started as a trainee solicitor Reynolds was speaking to the Times from Riyadh, where the UK is attempting to seal a trade agreement. Speaking of his own experience as a solicitor learning from senior colleagues, he said there were clear benefits to being in the workplace: ""I think there are times when it is absolutely necessary, it's legitimate to need the workforce in the office. You're basically learning from more experienced colleagues on the job."" He added: ""The UK has very significant regional inequality. It [offering the chance to work from home] could play a significant contribution to tackling that. ""A lot of businesses will say their motivation for being a workplace that offers this is because it opens up a much wider group of talent that they can recruit. Reynolds emphasised the importance of retaining probationary periods when a new employee starts a job. But he acknowledged that negotiations are continuing on the length of these. He said it was ""not right"" that some staff had to wait two years to gain full rights, but declined in the interview to suggest how long the probationary period should be. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner held a meeting with trade union and business representatives last month to discuss the proposals. Following the meeting, Tina McKenzie, policy chairwoman at the Federation of Small Businesses said it was ""crucial"" for the government to ""try and reduce harm to employment, small businesses and the economy from any and every negative impact of these proposals"". Jonathan Geldart, director general of the Institute of Directors, said ""meaningful dialogue"" would be vital in determining whether the proposals would ""support or stifle economic growth"".

A scaled-down version of the event, featuring fewer sports and athletes, will return to the city 12 years after it last hosted the Games. The Australian state of Victoria was originally chosen to stage the multi-sport event but withdrew as host due to rising costs. Australian authorities have promised ""a multi-million pound investment"" to help finalise the deal. Health and Sport Minister Neil Gray held talks with Commonwealth Games Australia on Monday to discuss funding, and received the assurances the Scottish government were looking for. It has now written to the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) to officially back a ""a scaled back, but high-quality"" event which will see see 10 sports take place across four venues in the city. The compulsory sports of Athletics and Swimming will be held at Scotstoun Stadium and Tollcross International Swimming Centre but the additional venues, as well as the dates for the event, have not yet been confirmed.

Media caption, Neil Gray said it would be a ""very different Commonwealth Games"" Gray said the fact that the city was asked to step in and host the games was a ""testament to Glasgow and Scotland’s fantastic reputation for hosting international events"". He said: ""In 2026 all eyes will once again be on Glasgow, and I have every confidence that Scotland’s largest city will provide a fitting platform for some of the world’s top athletes.” The minister added that CGS would be responsible for the budget and delivery of the event. He told BBC Scotland News: ""If there is a situation where we go beyond a very substantial contingency, CGS will need to look at the way then Games are being delivered rather than calling on either the UK or Scottish government for resource."" He added that he hoped a more ""sustainable offering"" would allow for a more ""diverse mix of countries to host the games in the future"". Scottish Secretary Ian Murray said this was a ""positive outcome"" for both Glasgow and the Commonwealth Games. He said: ""There are still a few hoops to jump through but I'm very much looking forward to an incredible celebration of sport and seeing Scottish athletes in action in front of a home crowd."" What do athletes think about Glasgow 2026? Attribution Sport Published 2 hours ago Olympic champion McClenaghan's Commonwealth relief Attribution Sport Published 2 hours ago CGF president Chris Jenkins said it would work closely with Commonwealth Games Scotland to formally announce Glasgow as the host city as soon a possible. He said: ""We believe Glasgow 2026 will be an important first step in our commitment to reset and reframe the Commonwealth Games as a co-created, sustainable model that minimises costs, inspires athletes, and excites hosts and International federations."" He confirmed that Commonwealth Games Australia had contributed £2.3m to ""enhance the event"". Ian Reid, chairman of Commonwealth Games Scotland (CGS), said he was ""delighted"" at the confirmation. He said: “We have been clear from the outset that our Games concept for Glasgow 2026 aligns with the CGF's strategy to make the Games more accessible for future hosts, whilst ensuring that public funds are not required. Image source, SNS Image caption, The 2014 Games featured a lavish opening ceremony at Celtic Park Mr Reid added: ""Glasgow is one of the few cities in the Commonwealth that can deliver on time given its world-class facilities, experienced workforce and strong supply chain. “This is a really exciting opportunity and we will be working hard over the coming days to bring the final pieces of the puzzle together."" A final decision was taken at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning. Organisers have stated the Games will come at no cost to the public purse, with funding coming from compensation paid to the CGF after the Australians pulled out. The UK government will provide financial support in the event of any increased security threat but had refused to completely underwrite the Games. Gray previously insisted that there was ""a reputation risk as well as financial risk"" for Scotland in taking on hosting duties again, and that no public funds could be used. The total budget for the Games is expected to be about £114m. Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar said: “Glasgow is a great city, but it is in need of economic investment and renewal. “By hosting the games, we can showcase Glasgow and Scotland on the international stage and bring investment and tourism here. “This is our chance to complete the legacy of the 2014 games, show global leadership and deliver the change that Glasgow needs."" Image source, SNS Image caption, Usain Bolt was one of the star attractions in 2014 Sandesh Gulhane, Scottish Conservatives' health spokesman, welcomed the ""fantastic news"" that is set to be delivered at ""no cost to hard-pressed taxpayers"". “This will put Glasgow on the map around the world and is an ideal chance to promote everything that is great about it,"" he said. ""However, I hope by then that the state of our city is much improved compared to how it looks now."" Glasgow last hosted the Games in 2014 at a cost of £543m, with 17 sports taking place in an event praised by organisers as the best ever. The 2026 version will be a more modest affair, but it it is not yet clear which sports will be cut. There will be no athlete’s village and any opening and closing ceremonies are expected to be scaled back. Former Team Scotland athlete and swimmer, Hannah Miley told BBC Scotland News the Commonwealth Games was a ""special event"" for athletes. She said: “There were so many great memories from 2014 so to have it again in 2026, I think will be a great opportunity. “Being able to compete in front of a home nation is something not many athletes get to do. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.” The retired swimmer added that while it was amazing that Glasgow would be hosting the Games again, she had “mixed emotions” that some sports would not be included. In 2021, the CGF agreed , external that athletics and swimming would be made compulsory sports, while events such as Archery and Boxing would be made core sports. It is not yet clear which sports will be excluded from the 2026 Games. Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Hannah Miley, who won silver for Team Scotland at Glasgow 2014, said the Games was a special event for athletes The Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) has struggled to find hosts for the event in recent years. Durban was supposed to be the first city in Africa to stage the Games in 2022, but were stripped of hosting rights in 2017 after running into money troubles. Birmingham and the British government intervened to save the event, stumping up a combined $1bn for what became the best attended Games on record. Victoria then dropped out in July 2023 after the projected cost for the event became ""well and truly too much"" for the state to bear, while other possible hosts such as Malaysia and Singapore declined to step in. The 12-day competition was expected to cost more than A$6 bn (£3.13bn; $4.09bn). Leon Thompson, executive director of UK Hospitality Scotland, said: ""The Games will deliver an economic boost to Glasgow, as well as creating opportunities to promote the city’s attractions over the next few years as it prepares to welcome visitors from across the world."" He added that hospitality businesses would benefit from increased footfall but called on Glasgow City Council to ensure ""economic and reputational benefits"" were maximised.

"Junior doctors want more despite backing pay deal - BBC News BBC Homepage Skip to content Accessibility Help Your account Notifications Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds Bitesize More menu More menu Search BBC Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds Bitesize CBBC CBeebies Food Close menu BBC News Menu Home InDepth Israel-Gaza war US election Cost of Living War in Ukraine Climate UK World Business More Politics Culture Tech Science Health Family & Education In Pictures Newsbeat BBC Verify Disability Health Junior doctors want more despite backing pay deal Image source, PA Media Nick Triggle Health correspondent @nicktriggle Published 16 September 2024 Comments Updated 4 hours ago Junior doctors in England have accepted the government’s offer of a 22% pay rise, but warn they will want more in the coming years. Members of the British Medical Association backed the deal offered by the government with 66% voting in favour of the increase, which is spread over two years. Nearly 46,000 took part in the online ballot. It brings to an end the 18-month dispute, which saw junior doctors take part in 11 separate strikes. But the BMA warned this must be just the start of a series of above-inflation pay rises or there would be ""consequences"". 'Campaign not over' The union's junior doctor co-leader, Dr Vivek Trivedi, told the BBC the deal had only started ""to turn the tide on pay cuts"". He described it as a ""compromise"" - the BMA had been after a 35% pay rise to make up for what it says are 15 years of below-inflation pay awards. He said in future years the expectation was that pay would continue going up above inflation - and if that did not happen the government needed to be “prepared for consequences”. ""It does mark the start of the journey, but the journey is not over."" The deal increases the starting salary for a junior doctor from £29,384 in 2022-23 to £36,616 a year in basic pay. Those at the top end of the pay scale earn more than £70,000. But junior doctors typically make 25% to 30% more on top in extra payments for things like additional work and unsocial hours. The offer was made by Health Secretary Wes Streeting in late July – just weeks after Labour won the election. He said he was “pleased” it had been accepted, ending the “most devastating dispute in the health service’s history”. “This marks the necessary first step in our mission to cut waiting lists, reform the broken health service, and make it fit for the future,"" Streeting added. The pay deal includes a 4% backdated pay rise for 2023-24, on top of the existing increase they have already received worth an average of 9% for the last financial year. A further pay rise worth about 8% will be paid for 2024-25, as recommended by an independent pay review body. The junior doctors' strikes may be over. But is trouble ahead? Published 2 August That brings the total over the two years to around 22%, on average, for each junior doctor, with the lowest paid set to receive the largest increases. Industrial action in the NHS is estimated to have cost taxpayers around £1.7 billion during 2023 and 2024. 'Sigh of relief' Danny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, which represents NHS trusts, said: “Health leaders will breathe a massive sigh of relief to know that the dispute has come to a successful resolution. “The last thing our members wanted was the threat of more strikes over what is expected to be a very difficult winter.” Junior doctors in Wales recently voted in favour of an improved pay deal, while in Northern Ireland talks are ongoing and no strike action is currently planned. Junior doctors did not take industrial action in Scotland after they accepted a pay offer from the devolved government last year. The announcement comes ahead of the title of junior doctor being dropped in favour of the term resident doctors from Wednesday. Streeting agreed to the change during the talks. The term junior doctor has long been disliked by the BMA, which believes it did not reflect the experience and standing of junior doctors - some of whom can have eight or more years experience.

You’ll be looking at the second supermoon of the year – the term for when the moon’s orbit is closest to Earth while it is full. “I think people forget to look up a lot of the time,” says Dr Sara Webb, an Australian astrophysicist at Swinburne University in Melbourne. “It is nice to go out and look at the sky … and enjoy a full moon when you can.” What is a supermoon? Earth’s moon is not always the same distance from Earth. “When it is at its closest approach, that is when we call any full moon a supermoon,” Webb says. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The supermoon will be about 357,000km from Earth – 27000km closer than it normally is. “Quite a distance,” as Webb notes. There are normally between two and four supermoons a year. Where can I see it? The best way to view the supermoon is as it rises above the horizon , “where you can really get that perspective of it compared to things on the Earth,” Webb says. That will fall around 6pm for people in Sydney and Melbourne, 7pm for those in London and New York , and 7:30pm for the US west coast. Find a viewing spot that is dark and looks towards the east, which is where the moon will rise. Locations on the east coast of Australia in Brisbane and Sydney are prime viewing sites, Webb says. Dr Bradley Tucker, an astrophysicist at the Australian National University in Canberra, says the rising supermoon will look “really cool” in any flat location, such as the US east coast or central Australia. Webb says to avoid places crowded with buildings. “Once it gets to a certain point in the sky, it will look like any other full moon.” The supermoon will reach its highest and fullest point in the sky about half past midnight in Australia and just after 10:30pm on the US east coast. If you miss this supermoon, don’t fret. Another two are set to occur, on 17 October and 15 November this year. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Morning Mail Free daily newsletter Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A partial lunar eclipse will also happen on Wednesday but it won’t be visible from Australia. The best spots to see that phenomenon are South America, west Africa and western Europe, Tucker says. “It is happening during (the Australian) daytime, and the moon is going to be on the other side of the Earth,” Webb says. The phenomenon occurs when the moon appears to be in line with the sun. Lunar and solar eclipses are chance alignments of “our three kind of heavenly bodies,” Webb says. “Our Earth is between the sun and moon.” A partial eclipse is “not quite in alignment,” but is still something to look out for. One of the most remarkable lunar phenomena is a full lunar eclipse – often referred to as a blood moon , Webb says. What is a blue supermoon and when will it appear in UK skies?

September’s moon also happens to be a supermoon. It is named the Harvest Moon because the middle of September is when autumn harvest begins. “So the Harvest Moon really doesn’t make sense for us [in the southern hemisphere] because it’s kind of the reverse,” Tucker says.

Photograph: Daniela Cossio Neuroscience Scans capture sweeping reorganisation of brain in pregnancy MRIs taken from before conception until two years after birth show some short-lived changes and some lasting years Ian Sample Science editor Mon 16 Sep 2024 16.00 BST Share Profound changes that sweep across the human brain during pregnancy have been captured for the first time, after researchers performed precision scans on a woman carrying her child. MRI scans taken every few weeks from before conception until two years after childbirth revealed widespread reorganisation in the mother’s brain, with some changes short-lived and others lasting years. The work, described as “truly heroic” by one independent expert, paves the way for a far deeper understanding of the mother’s brain in pregnancy. Further scans are now being gathered from other pregnant women to learn about the risks of postnatal depression , the link between pre-eclampsia and dementia , and why pregnancy can reduce migraines and symptoms of multiple sclerosis . Scientists took 26 brain scans of a healthy 38-year-old woman who conceived via IVF, and concurrent blood samples to monitor the dramatic surges in hormones during pregnancy. The data revealed how the brain changed, week by week. Most apparent was a steady decrease in grey matter, the wrinkly outer surface of the brain, throughout pregnancy and a temporary peak in neural connectivity at the end of the second trimester. “The maternal brain undergoes this choreographed change across gestation and we’re finally able to observe the process in real time,” said Prof Emily Jacobs, a researcher on the study at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Scientists have previously taken snapshots of women’s brains at various points in pregnancy, but the latest work shows how these can miss temporary changes that revert to normal by the time the woman gives birth. Writing in Nature Neuroscience , the lead author, Laura Pritschet, and her colleagues describe how soaring hormones, such as oestrogen and progesterone, drive significant physiological changes in pregnancy, affecting blood plasma, metabolism, oxygen consumption and immunity. The same hormones resculpt the brain. To understand more, the researchers used precision MRI to scan the brain of Dr Elizabeth Chrastil, a colleague at the University of California, Irvine. She was scanned before conceiving, during pregnancy and for two years after her son was born in May 2020. “It was quite an intense undertaking,” Chrastil said, but added that she did not feel particularly different in pregnancy. “Some people talk about ‘mummy brain’ and things like that, and I didn’t really experience any of that.” The scans revealed widespread reductions in grey matter volume and thickness, particularly in regions involved with social cognition. White matter microstructure, a measure of the brain’s wiring, increased to a peak at the end of the second trimester before dropping back down. Cerebrospinal fluid and brain cavities known as ventricles both expanded. The changes were linked to rising hormone levels. “Sometimes people bristle when they hear that grey matter volume decreases in pregnancy,” Jacobs said. “This change probably reflects the fine tuning of neural circuits, not unlike the cortical thinning that happens during puberty.” The researchers compared the process to the sculpting of Michelangelo’s David from a block of marble. The study does not explain behaviours or emotions that arise in pregnancy, and many factors beyond hormones, such as stress and sleep loss, are at play. But some brain changes were still present two years after childbirth, hinting at cellular changes in the organ. “This paper really opens up more questions than it answers,” Chrastil said. “We’re really just starting to scratch the surface.” The work marks the launch of the Maternal Brain Project , an international effort to gather similar scans from more pregnant women. Jacobs said: “There is so much about the neurobiology of pregnancy that we don’t understand yet and it’s not because women are too complicated, it’s not because pregnancy is some Gordian knot, it’s a byproduct of the fact that the biomedical sciences have historically ignored women’s health.” Gina Rippon, a professor emeritus of cognitive neuro-imaging at Aston University in Birmingham, England, said it was “a truly heroic” project, adding: “The data from this study illustrate just how much we have been missing.” Dr Ann-Marie de Lange, the leader of the FemiLab group at Lausanne university hospital , called the work “fascinating”. “This approach will not only help us map maternal neuroplasticity, but also identify markers that indicate risk for postpartum depression, a serious condition that often goes untreated,” she said.

The poker puzzle that has everyone fooled The answers to today’s counter-intuitive conundrums Alex Bellos Mon 16 Sep 2024 17.00 BST Last modified on Tue 17 Sep 2024 07.22 BST Share Earlier today I set you these two puzzles, which are extracts from my new book Think Twice: Solve the Simple Puzzles (Almost) Everyone Gets Wrong. Here they are again with solutions. 1) Pint-sized problem Which is longer? a) the height of this pint glass, or b) the circumference of its rim? View image in fullscreen Comment: you may have seen this question in the context of classic UK pint glasses, but I am asking about continental style pint glasses, which are much thinner and higher. Solution b) The rim is longer. Next time you are in a pub, ask anyone this question. They will invariably say the height. But with a traditional pint glass, the circumference is almost twice as long as the height. Even with this extremely svelte Peroni glass, the rim nudges it. It doesn’t look like it is true but it is. The circumference of a circle is pi (3.14 to two decimal places) times the diameter. The diameter of a Peroni glass is 76mm, giving a circumference of 238mm. The height is a mere 231mm. The moral of the story: humans are very bad at intuiting circumferences. We are used to measuring lengths as straight lines. When we see a glass side on, we look left to right and back again. But the circumference is not double the diameter – it is more than three times as long. Dont forget the pi in pint! 2) Fool House You are playing poker. Which is the stronger of the two hands below? View image in fullscreen For clarification, the highest ranked poker hands are, in order from the strongest, royal flush , straight flush, four-of-a-kind, and full house . When two hands of the same rank face off, the winner is the hand with the cards of highest value. (For a more detailed description of the ranks see below.) UPDATE: Extra clarification: you are playing ‘five card stud’ in which you are dealt five cards, with no shared cards on the table. Solution b) is stronger. People here fall into the trap of thinking that I am asking which hand is stronger if the hands are playing against each other. If that were the case, the first hand would be stronger because it has the higher value cards. However, they cannot be playing against each other! Poker uses a single deck and there are only four aces is total. If one player has the first hand, no one has the second hand, and vice versa. The meaning of ‘stronger’ in the context of the puzzle is the hand that puts a player in the stronger position in a game. Perhaps a more concise setting of the puzzle is ‘Which hand would you rather be dealt?’ Both hands are equally strong against other full houses and four-of-a-kinds. But AAA99 blocks more straight flushes, since it means an opponent cannot have 5-9, 6-10, 7-J, 8-Q or 9-K. The AAAKK only blocks 9-K. The effect is only marginal (perhaps a reader will want to calculate the percentages) but it is there! I hope you enjoyed these puzzles. If you did, Think Twice has many more. The book is just out, and – dare I mention Christmas? – it would make a perfect gift. The puzzles are designed to be fun when solving as a group. Thanks to Shoma Amin from Asahi UK. Poker definitions: a royal flush is a run of AKQJ10 in a single suit, a straight flush is any other run of consecutive cards in the same suit, a four-of-a-kind is a hand with all four cards of the same value, and a full house is two of one value and three of the other.

Photograph: Dan Himbrechts/AAP Skin cancer Half of advanced melanoma patients live for 10 years with double drug treatment Experts hail ‘remarkable’ trial results for treatment of a form of skin cancer that once had grim prognosis Ian Sample Science editor Sun 15 Sep 2024 13.35 BST Last modified on Mon 16 Sep 2024 02.30 BST Share More than half of people diagnosed with advanced melanoma now survive for at least 10 years when they receive a double hit of immunotherapy drugs, a trial has found. The combined treatment has transformed survival rates for a form of skin cancer that once had a grim prognosis, with some patients now living long enough that they die from other causes. Fifteen years ago, only one in 20 patients with advanced melanoma survived for five years, with many dying within six to nine months of the condition being confirmed. “The definition of cure is to return someone to their normal life expectancy for their age and state of health,” said James Larkin, a consultant medical oncologist at the Royal Marsden NHS foundation trust and a professor at the Institute of Cancer Research. “Having treated a lot of these patients over the past 10 years it seems that some are cured: they’re back to their normal lives, they’re getting on with things.” More than 20,000 people are expected to be diagnosed with melanoma in the UK this year, a record high that is largely being driven by rising cases in older people. The vast majority of cases are preventable and caused by too much exposure to UV light. The trial explored two drugs, ipilimumab and nivolumab, both immune checkpoint inhibitors, in 945 patients with stage 3 or 4 melanoma, where tumours were spreading. The drugs work by disabling “brakes” built into the immune system to prevent it from turning on healthy tissues. Cut the brakes and the immune system can recognise and attack the cancer cells. The approach is highly effective. Results presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology in Barcelona on Sunday, and published in the New England Journal of Medicine , show that the melanoma-specific survival rate for patients in the trial was higher than the overall survival rate, meaning they were starting to live long enough to die from other causes. At 10 years, the melanoma-specific survival rate for patients treated with both drugs was 52%. Larkin called the results “remarkable”. Many toxic anti-cancer drugs that destroy tumours cells stop working over time, but the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors is long-lasting. The trial marks the longest follow-up to date of patients receiving the drugs for advanced melanoma, giving doctors crucial information on how long the treatment is effective for, the overall survival rates and side-effects. While some patients experienced side-effects early on, no new problems arose later. Patients who stopped treatment early because of significant side-effects still benefited from the combination therapy, as the drugs had already taken effect on their immune systems. Lucy Davis, 47, joined the trial funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb, the drug manufacturer, after being diagnosed in 2011 with stage 3 melanoma. She had surgery to remove the cancer and surrounding lymph nodes, but two years later was told the disease had progressed to stage 4 and she had only months to live. “Before I started the trial I was really ill, I could barely eat, I was losing weight and was in a lot of pain, but three months later I felt completely different, my appetite was back and scans showed that the treatment was working,” Davis said. “My children were five and seven years old when I received the news that I had just months to live; and they are now 16 and 18. I have been able to see them complete their exams and go to college, which is absolutely amazing.” While the results are impressive, efforts are now focused on the substantial portion of patients who do not respond to the immunotherapies. It is unclear why the drugs fail in many patients, and there is probably no single answer, with roles for the biology of the patient’s tumour and their immune system. Larkin said: “It’s great to see these data from a disease where 15 years ago average life expectancy was six to nine months. But we still have a significant group of people in the clinic who do not respond to this treatment. Where we’re focusing our energies as a field, in melanoma and in other cancers, is to try and understand that: why aren’t these people responding?” Dr Sam Godfrey, the science engagement lead at Cancer Research UK, said: “Over the last decade, there have been big improvements in survival for people with advanced melanoma skin cancer, partially because of the introduction of a group of immunotherapy drugs called checkpoint inhibitors. “This study indicates that combining two of these checkpoint inhibitors led to more people surviving their disease for 10 years or more. Promising results like this show how vital ongoing research into cancer is, to help people live longer, better lives.” Explore more on these topics Skin cancer Cancer Cancer research Health Medical research news Share Reuse this content More on this story More on this story Type of mouth bacteria ‘melts’ some cancers, study finds 27 Jul 2024 Scientists make DNA discovery that could help find pancreatic cancer cure 14 Jul 2024 ‘Off the charts’: the key breakthroughs giving new hope in treating cancer 7 Jun 2024 UK cancer study shows big fall in death rates since early 1990s 13 Mar 2024 ‘Extremely impressive’: melanoma jab trial results excite doctors 4 Jun 2024 Drug that ‘melts away’ tumours hailed as ‘gamechanger’ for some bowel cancer patients 3 Jun 2024 Proteins in blood could provide early cancer warning ‘by more than seven years’ 15 May 2024 Health expert Tim Spector criticised for remarks on year-round use of sunscreen 13 May 2024 ‘Real hope’ for cancer cure as personal mRNA vaccine for melanoma trialled 26 Apr 2024 Most viewed Most viewed UK World Climate crisis Ukraine Football Newsletters Business Environment UK politics Education Society Science Tech Global development Obituaries News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email About us Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Modern Slavery Act Tax strategy Digital newspaper archive Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn X Newsletters Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Patrons Back to top © 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Kwangmoozaa/Getty Images/iStockphoto Global health Analysis Drug-resistant infections are on the rise – so why aren’t we getting any new antibiotics? Kat Lay Global health correspondent World leaders will meet in New York this month to discuss growing antimicrobial resistance as researchers warn the development of replacement drugs is stalling Superbugs ‘could kill 39m people by 2050’ amid rising drug resistance Supported by About this content Mon 16 Sep 2024 23.30 BST Share Almost a century on from the groundbreaking discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming, his scientific successors are racing to save modern medicine. Infections that were once easy to cure with antibiotics are becoming untreatable , and a novel treatment for bacterial infection is the holy grail for teams of researchers around the world. However, severe financial challenges have left the pipeline of new antibiotics thin and fragile – and treatments are unavailable in many of the places they are most needed . Big pharmaceutical companies have left the field in search of greater profits elsewhere, and talented researchers have opted for new jobs in more stable sectors. The number of deaths caused by drug-resistant bacteria in 2019 was 1.27 million , and economic costs are on track to exceed $1tn (£765bn) by 2030 . The death rate is highest in sub-Saharan Africa, where children under five are particularly affected. “This is a problem which truly affects the whole world, rich and poor countries alike,” says Jeremy Knox, the head of infectious disease policy at Wellcome. “[But] the impact is definitely asymmetrical. People in low and middle-income countries are bearing a far greater burden.” Global leaders will gather in New York this month to discuss antimicrobial resistance (AMR) at the UN general assembly. They will consider how to convince researchers and companies it is worth their while to create new replacement drugs, and how to improve access to tests and treatments. The World Health Organization produces an annual list of drug-resistant pathogens that are of the highest concern. In June it warned there were too few antibacterials to fight them in development. View image in fullscreen A newborn baby is registered at a hospital in Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The number of deaths caused by drug-resistant bacteria is highest in sub-Saharan Africa, where children under five are particularly affected. Photograph: Per-Anders Pettersson/Getty Images “We face a crisis of innovation,” says Damiano de Felice, the chief of external affairs at Carb-X, a nonprofit organisation that aims to accelerate the development of such products. Only one new class of antibiotics has been discovered or patented since 1990, he says – a sharp decrease considering more than 25 were discovered between 1940 and 1979. There are a lot of new, promising approaches in the early stages of development, he says, “but most of the product developers in this space are very vulnerable”. Of 112 commercial institutions identified by the WHO as conducting preclinical research to develop new products against AMR, 97 had fewer than 50 employees. Anand Anandjumar is the co-founder and chief executive of Bugworks, one of the small companies working in AMR research. “We are hardly 30 people,” he says, adding that the company – based in Bengaluru, India – “couldn’t be here” without the support of funders such as the Wellcome Trust, Carb-X and the Indian government. In recent years, the few companies that have been successful at bringing new products to market have “done very poorly, financially”, says De Felice, with many going bankrupt. People in low and middle-income countries are bearing a far greater burden Jeremy Knox, Wellcome That record deters commercial investors and contributes to a brain drain from the sector, with researchers who start out working on AMR moving to other fields after companies collapse or funding disappears. “It’s really hard to make a lot of money from an antibiotic,” says Laura Piddock, scientific director at the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GardP), which is working on new treatments. Cheap drugs for chronic conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure can still make companies big profits, because they are taken by a lot of people for a long period – often a lifetime. By contrast, antibiotics are used for a short period to deal with infections. Piddock is optimistic that the scientific challenges of finding new chemical compounds to fight troublesome bacteria can be overcome, particularly with the advent of new tools such as artificial intelligence. The bigger challenge is translating that research into new treatments, she says. “Whether you’re big pharma or a small nonprofit like GardP, it still costs millions.” Access even to existing drugs remains an issue in countries of all income levels, she says, with many companies marketing their drugs in fewer than 10 countries “for financial reasons”. It means patients in hospital with sepsis may not have access to antibiotics “that you and I take for granted”. An Access to Medicine Foundation report this year found that was unlikely to change. Looking at five big pharma drugs at a late stage of development for some of the “most severe drug-resistant pathogens”, researchers identified concrete commitments to register them for use in only five low and middle-income countries. View image in fullscreen Staphylococcus epidermidis , a superbug resistant to all known antibiotics. Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty Images The issue needs incentives that push innovation, De Felice says, such as grants to support early-stage research from governments and the third sector. It also needs incentives that pull drugs through to market and guarantee companies a return on their investment, even if the antibiotics are not used but held in reserve as a last resort for particularly severe infections. Some of those programmes exist already. In the UK, drug companies can receive a fixed annual fee for new antibiotics regardless of how much they are used. The subscription model bases payments on how valuable the drugs are to the health system. ‘It’s happening on the scale of a pandemic’: the drug-resistant infections killing African babies Read more A similar approach is under consideration in the US – although some global health campaigners fear it is too domestic in focus and will drive up the price of new antibiotics across the world, making it harder than ever for people in developing countries to get hold of them. Multiple countries will need to adopt similar incentives to sufficiently stimulate the market, Piddock says. Some countries where it is harder to access drugs can also lack vaccines and even basic water and sanitation, which can make infection more likely. “What we need is to ensure when we develop new innovations such as diagnostics and antibiotics that they are accessible and affordable in all countries, and to all populations within countries,” says Esmita Charani, an associate professor at the University of Cape Town and honorary reader in infectious diseases, AMR and global health at the University of Liverpool.

Photograph: Jeenah Moon/AP Mpox UK orders 150,000 mpox vaccine doses amid spread of new strain in Africa Health officials say jabs needed to bolster UK’s resilience after WHO declares clade Ib outbreak a global emergency Andrew Gregory Health editor Mon 16 Sep 2024 16.52 BST Last modified on Mon 16 Sep 2024 21.18 BST Share The UK has ordered more than 150,000 doses of vaccine against mpox to bolster its preparedness after the World Health Organization declared a surge in cases in Africa to be a global emergency. No cases of clade Ib mpox, the new strain that has spread rapidly in Africa after an initial outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), have yet been detected in the UK. However, UK health officials said at a briefing on Monday that ordering more vaccine was necessary to bolster the country’s resilience against the virus, formerly known as monkeypox. They also set out three scenarios illustrating the possible impact of a UK outbreak. The first involved small clusters of cases, the second a “controllable epidemic” and the third community transmission in hospitals, care homes, prisons and schools. None of the scenarios outlined were projections or predictions, officials said. “We are preparing for any cases that we might see in the UK and vaccination plays a vital part in our defences,” said Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser at the UK Health Security Agency. “Alongside vaccination, we have been working rapidly to ensure that clinicians are aware and able to recognise cases promptly, that rapid testing is available, and that protocols are developed for the safe clinical care of people who have the infection and the prevention of onward transmission.” Mpox is passed on through close physical contact. The disease causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions, and is usually mild but can kill. Children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of complications. The vaccine, made by Bavarian Nordic, would be offered to those eligible in stages, and based on clinical need, health officials said. Gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men; certain healthcare workers and specialist healthcare and humanitarian workers who go to affected countries; and close contacts of confirmed mpox cases would be offered vaccines, officials said. Clade Ib has prompted more concern among health officials than clade IIb, which was responsible for a global outbreak of the virus in 2022. Small numbers of cases of clade IIb have been present in the UK for about two years. A vaccination programme was launched in the summer of 2022 and closed in the summer of 2023. It is understood that about 50,000 people have had two doses of the jab, which is 80% effective at preventing mpox cases, while more than 83,000 have had one dose. Steve Russell, NHS England’s director for vaccinations and screening, said that while the risk of catching mpox in the UK was low, vaccination offered “a vital level of protection” for those most likely to be exposed. “We encourage those eligible to come forward when invited by local health services, to ensure they have the best defence,” he added. The health secretary, Wes Streeting, said he was closely monitoring the spread of mpox overseas. He added: “No cases of clade Ib mpox have been detected in the UK, but we are taking steps to ensure the country is prepared with a robust vaccination programme that protects those who may be at high risk.” Explore more on these topics Mpox Vaccines and immunisation Health policy Infectious diseases Health Medical research news Share Reuse this content Most viewed Most viewed World Europe US Americas Asia Australia Middle East Africa Inequality Global development News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email About us Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Modern Slavery Act Tax strategy Digital newspaper archive Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn X Newsletters Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Patrons Back to top © 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

On Friday, the Los Angeles Times reported that researchers had discovered two sites on the campus of San Pedro high school under which fossils including those of a saber-toothed salmon and a megalodon, the gigantic prehistoric shark, were buried. According to the outlet, the two sites where the fossils were found include an 8.7m-year-old bone bed from the Miocene era and a 120,000-year-old shell bed from the Pleistocene era. The discoveries were made between June 2022 and July 2024, LAist reports . In a statement to the Los Angeles Times, Richard Behl, a California State University at Long Beach geologist, said that researchers were testing the chemical and mineral composition of the fossils. “We got to find clues and piece those clues together,” Behl said, adding that fossils from the Miocene era were encased in diatomite, a sedimentary rock composed of the fossilized skeletal remains of single-cell aquatic algae. According to Behl, the diatomite indicates that the area was rich with algae, which helped foster a rich ecosystem that comprised various marine creatures. Echoing Behl, Wayne Bischoff, the director of cultural resources at Envicom Corporation, told LAist: “It’s the entire ecosystem from an age that’s gone … We have all this evidence to help future researchers put together what an entire ecology looked like nine million years ago. That’s really rare.” View image in fullscreen Among the fossils found under San Pedro high school are teeth from the juvenile megalodon (right), and those from mako sharks (center). Photograph: Wayne Bischoff/Envicom Corp Photos published on LAist and in the Los Angeles Times feature a vertebrae fossil and rib bone of an extinct dolphin species, jawbone of an extinct saber-tooth salmon, which had extendable fangs from its mouth, and fossils of hundreds of small fish vertebrae. Speaking to KABC, Austin Hendy, assistant curator at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, said that researchers believe “there was a submarine channel that was carrying material down from shallower water into deeper water and volcanism going on somewhere in the vicinity”. “This was a big surprise to everybody when they started digging these trenches to unearth these fish fossils,” Hendy added. According to the Los Angeles Times, the fossils have been distributed among research and educational institutions, including the Los Angeles unified school district, the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro, California State University Channel Islands and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. In a statement to KABC, the LAUSD superintendent, Alberto Carvalho, said that the discovery of the fossils had “led to a new era of concentrative studies that will bring notoriety to this community and this high school”.

Photograph: Brian Snyder/Reuters Ig Nobel prizes Ig Nobel prize goes to team who found mammals can breathe through anuses Scientific research on pigeon missiles and dead trout also win at awards for amusing studies with serious implications Ian Sample Science editor Thu 12 Sep 2024 23.00 BST Last modified on Fri 13 Sep 2024 02.31 BST Share In a stark demonstration of how award-winning breakthroughs can come from the most unlikely directions, researchers have won an Ig Nobel prize for discovering that mammals can breathe through their anuses. After a series of tests on mice, rats and pigs, Japanese scientists found the animals absorb oxygen delivered through the rectum, work that underpins a clinical trial to see whether the procedure can treat respiratory failure. The team is among 10 recognised in this year’s Ig Nobel awards (see below for more), the irreverent accolades given for achievements that “first make people laugh, and then make them think”. They are not to be confused with the more lucrative and career-changing Nobel prizes to be handed out in Scandinavia next month. The latest crop of Ig Nobel winners received their awards at a ceremony at Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Thursday. The event featured real Nobel laureates to distribute the prizes, “24/7” lectures in which experts first explained their subject in 24 seconds, then in seven words, and copious paper-plane throwing. View image in fullscreen A diagram from BF Skinner’s Project Pigeon experiment on using birds to guide missiles. Photograph: BF Skinner/PA Other work honoured on the night included US research to house pigeons in missiles to help guide them to their targets; UK investigations which found that claims of extreme old age tend to come from areas that have short average lifespans and and a historical lack of birth certificates, and a French study which found that scalp hair tends to whorl in a clockwise direction, though less so in the southern hemisphere. The Japanese researchers became interested in whether humans with breathing difficulties might benefit from having oxygen pumped up their backsides after noting that some animals, such as loaches, can use their intestines to breathe. They began the work in the Covid crisis when many hospitals were desperately short of mechanical ventilators to support breathing in people with severe infections. The team’s experiments, which earned the Ig Nobel prize in physiology, showed that mice, rats and pigs could absorb oxygen into the bloodstream when it was delivered via the rectum, thus supporting normal breathing. Writing in the journal Med in 2021 , Ryo Okabe at Tokyo Medical and Dental University and colleagues described how “enteral ventilation” offered “a new paradigm” to help patients in respiratory failure. Dr Takanori Takebe, an author of the study at Cincinnati children’s hospital medical centre, confessed to “mixed feelings” on hearing of the award, but warmed to it on finding out it was recognised for making people laugh and then think. If it fuelled interest in enteral ventilation, he said, “I’d be so happy.” The team is running a phase 1 trial in human volunteers. Dr Saul Newman at the University of Oxford bagged the demography prize for showing that many claims of people living extraordinarily long lives come from places with short life spans, no birth certificates, and where clerical errors and pension fraud abound. “Extreme old age records are a statistical basket case,” he said. “From the level of individual cases, up to broad population patterns, virtually none of our old-age data makes sense.” Prof Roman Khonsari, a craniofacial surgeon at the Necker-Enfants Malades university hospital in Paris, and colleagues won the anatomy prize for their global study of hair whorls. While scalp hair spirals in a clockwise direction on most people, their research found, there is more counter-clockwise spiralling in the southern hemisphere. “I was operating when I got the call,” Khonsari said. “I was extremely glad because, despite the undeniable irrelevance of this study, I am convinced that deciphering patterns in nature can lead to important discoveries on fundamental developmental mechanisms. Shapes carry interesting amounts of information.” The discovery led to comparisons with tornadoes, which typically rotate in different directions in the northern and southern hemispheres. Writing in the Journal of Stomatology, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery , the researchers theorised that the Coriolis effect, by which the Earth’s spin deflects winds to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere, could be at work. Not that Khonsari believes it. “Frankly, I don’t think it is a plausible hypothesis,” he said. The other winners of the 2024 Ig Nobel prizes Peace Awarded to the late BF Skinner, a US psychologist, for exploring the feasibility of housing live pigeons inside missiles to guide them to their targets. The project, which Skinner himself described as “ crackpot ”, was dropped despite a perfect demonstration involving a pigeon trained to target features on the New Jersey coastline. “The spectacle of a living pigeon carrying out its assignment, no matter how beautifully, simply reminded the committee of how utterly fantastic our proposal was,” Skinner wrote. Botany Given to Jacob White in the US and Felipe Yamashita in Germany for reporting evidence that the South American plant Boquila trifoliolata can mimic the leaves of plastic plants it is placed alongside, leading them to conclude that “plant vision” is a plausible hypothesis. Medicine Won by a Swiss, German and Belgian group for demonstrating that fake medicine that causes painful side-effects can be more effective in patients than fake medicine that does not cause painful side-effects. Physics Awarded to James Liao at the University of Florida for a comprehensive, multi - publication investigation into the swimming abilities of a dead trout . Probability Shared by a team of 50 researchers, mostly Dutch, who flipped 350,757 coins to test a hypothesis put forward by Persi Diaconis, a former magician and professor of statistics at Stanford University. Their work supported Diaconis’s prediction that tossed coins are (slightly) more likely to land the same way up as they started. Chemistry Another win for the Netherlands, with a team in Amsterdam using chromatography to separate drunk and sober worms , all the in the name of polymer science. Biology Another posthumous award, the Ig Nobel in biology honoured the late Fordyce Ely and William Petersen for their 1940 investigation into factors affecting the production of milk in dairy herds . Writing in the Journal of Animal Science, the pair recounted placing a cat on the back of a cow and repeatedly exploding paper bags to see if milk-flow changed. The terrified cows appeared to release less milk. “Frightening at first consisted in placing a cat on the cow’s back and exploding paper bags every 10 seconds for two minutes,” the researchers wrote. “Later the cat was dispensed with as unnecessary.” Explore more on these topics Ig Nobel prizes Science prizes Medical research Science (Education) Biology MIT - Massachusetts Institute of Technology news Share Reuse this content More on this story More on this story Reanimated spiders and smart toilets triumph at Ig Nobel prizes 14 Sept 2023 Frozen poo and narcissists' eyebrows studies win Ig Nobel prizes 17 Sept 2020 Study of French postmen's testicles is an Ig Nobel winner 12 Sept 2019 Voodoo doll and cannibalism studies triumph at Ig Nobels 13 Sept 2018 Solid and liquid cats, didgeridoos and cheese disgust scoop Ig Nobel awards 14 Sept 2017 … … comments Ig Nobel prizes: trousers for rats and the truthfulness of liars 22 Sept 2016 … … comments 'Universal law of urination' among Ig Nobel award winners – video 18 Sept 2015 2015 Ig Nobel prizes: dinosaur-like chickens and bee-stings to the penis 18 Sept 2015 … … comments Science Weekly The science of The Simpsons – podcast 29 Sept 2014 Most viewed Most viewed UK World Climate crisis Ukraine Football Newsletters Business Environment UK politics Education Society Science Tech Global development Obituaries News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email About us Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Modern Slavery Act Tax strategy Digital newspaper archive Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn X Newsletters Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Patrons Back to top © 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: MoMo Productions/Getty Images Neuroscience Covid lockdowns prematurely aged girls’ brains more than boys’, study suggests MRI scans found girls’ brains appeared 4.2 years older than expected, compared with 1.4 years for boys Ian Sample Science editor Mon 9 Sep 2024 20.00 BST Last modified on Wed 11 Sep 2024 12.16 BST Share Adolescent girls who lived through Covid lockdowns experienced more rapid brain ageing than boys, according to data that suggests the social restrictions had a disproportionate impact on them. MRI scans found evidence of premature brain ageing in both boys and girls, but girls’ brains appeared on average 4.2 years older than expected after lockdowns, compared with 1.4 years older for boys. It is unclear whether the changes have negative consequences, but the findings have raised concerns that they might affect adolescents’ mental health and potential to learn. “We were shocked by these data, that the difference is so dramatic,” said Prof Patricia Kuhl, co-director of the Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences at the University of Washington, in Seattle. The researchers gathered MRI scans from 160 nine- to 17-year-olds in 2018 and used them to build a model of how the brain’s cortex normally thins during school years. Some cortical thinning is natural and an important part of brain maturation and specialisation in adolescence. View image in fullscreen Brain scans reveal accelerated thinning of the cortex in adolescents who lived through the Covid pandemic. Photograph: University of Washington, Seattle The team revisited the same cohort in 2021 and 2022, after lockdowns, and collected further MRI scans from those aged 12 to 16. Compared with pre-pandemic brain development, these showed signs of accelerated cortical thinning in one area of the boys’ brains, and in 30 of the girls’ brains, across both hemispheres and all lobes. Other researchers have linked premature brain ageing to the pandemic, but the latest study, in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , is the first to reveal stark differences between boys and girls. Both sexes showed signs of accelerated ageing in a brain region linked to vision, potentially affecting the processing of faces. But in females, brain changes were widespread. Many affected areas underpinning social cognition with roles in processing emotions, interpreting facial expressions and language comprehension, which the researchers say are critical for communication. Kuhl believes the difference reflects girls’ greater dependence on social groups and interactions. “Girls chat endlessly and share their emotions,” she said. “They are much more dependent [than boys] on the social scene for their wellbeing and for their healthy neural, physical and emotional development.” More studies are needed to see whether the brain ageing affects cognitive performance, but Kuhl notes that premature cortical thinning is linked to early life adversity and a greater risk of neuropsychiatric disorders. Cortical thinning is crucial for the brain to specialise, but that comes with a loss of cognitive flexibility that could potentially affect learning. Kuhl said the findings were a “reminder of the fragility of teens” and suggested parents talk to their teenagers about their experiences of the pandemic. “It’s important they invite their teens for a coffee, for a tea, for a walk, to open the door to conversation,” she said. “Whatever it takes to get them to open up.” “It’s important to recognise that although the pandemic is largely over, the effects of the stress of the pandemic are still there for children and adolescents,” said Ian Gotlib, a professor of psychology at Stanford University who has reported similar brain changes . “Making sure that youth are supported in terms of their mental health is critical, perhaps now more than ever before.” “This adds to our understanding that adolescents experienced accelerated brain changes due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Dr Lina van Drunen, a researcher at Leiden University in the Netherlands, who has reported similar brain changes in adolescents . Identifying the specific factors behind the premature ageing and understanding its long-term impacts was now key, she added.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has been at the centre of an outbreak of the new clade 1b variant, with 18,000 suspected cases and 629 deaths this year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The variant has also been found in Burundi, Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Sweden and Thailand. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday that the first doses should arrive in the DRC “within days” but similar statements were recently made regarding donated shots from the US, which did not materialise on time. There has been no coordinated response, with Spain pledging as many as 500,000 doses while France and Germany have promised 100,000 each and the US said it will donate 50,000. None of the pledges have so far been delivered. View image in fullscreen WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday that the vaccines should arrive ‘within days’. Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) said on Wednesday that the $245m (£187m) it had requested to tackle the outbreak was only 10% funded. Despite mpox being first identified in humans in the DRC in 1970, African nations vulnerable to its spread are reliant on donations of vaccines from the stockpiles of richer nations. Dr Dimie Ogoina, an infectious disease physician at the Niger Delta University teaching hospital, said neglect both internationally and by African governments meant that, decades after mpox was first identified, there were still not enough vaccines or even treatments available to the affected countries. He said it was only during the global outbreak in 2022 , which saw the virus spread to Europe and North America, that there was a wider international reaction to the disease. Mpox screening stepped up globally as more cases emerge outside Africa Read more Ogoina said it was important for African countries themselves to invest in protecting against diseases such as mpox to ensure they are not reliant on donors. “The manufacturers are not based in Africa,” he said. “They tend to favour, knowingly or unknowingly, the global north. So if there’s a list of people to procure, Africa is always last in the list, and we are always the last to get supplies.” The WHO declared a public health emergency in mid-August in response to the spread of clade 1b, a recently identified variant that spreads through close physical contact, including sexual contact but also within households. Concern has been raised about high numbers of children dying, with a mortality rate of up to 8% for under-15s, according to the WHO . The latest update from Africa CDC on Tuesday showed a sharp rise in cases of almost 4,000, compared with 1,200 the previous week. Last week, civil society groups published a letter to Gavi, the global vaccine alliance, urging it to push for lower pricing of the vaccine produced by pharmaceutical company Bavarian Nordic, which currently costs between $50 and $75 a dose. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said that while the US government had invested in the development of the Jynneos vaccine used against mpox, the production and “outrageously high” prices were now being controlled by Bavarian Nordic. Victorine de Milliano, policy adviser at Médecins Sans Frontières’s wing for campaigning for fair medical treatment, MSF Access, said there was a “systematic issue” that meant that lower-income countries struggle to access medical tools in public health emergencies, which was highlighted during the Covid pandemic, when richer countries were able to stockpile vaccines, tests and treatments. “It’s a real feeling of deja vu. You would have thought that we would draw some lessons from the Covid-19 pandemic, but we see the same patterns again,” she said. “Low- and middle-income countries are also now reliant on those donations from high-income countries who do have access to the vaccines. And we also see a vaccine monopoly, [where they are] sold to the highest bidder.” Bavarian Nordic has told Africa CDC that it can provide 2m doses this year if it gets approval for orders, allowing it to reallocate resources from other production lines. A spokesperson for the company told the Guardian it had donated 55,000 doses and would provide an update when an agreement was made to start delivering more widely. The company also said it was open to using tiered pricing so that countries with smaller economies would be charged less as well as those who were able to order more vaccines and over longer periods of time. Ogoina said there were promising signs of political leaders in Africa showing vigilance in response to the public health emergency and discussing how they can invest in tackling it, as well as pledges of support from outside the continent, but it would have to be sustained. “[There have been] a lot of commitments, pronouncements, promises, but what happens after three months? What happens after six months? What happens after one year? Will people still be interested, or will they lose interest?” he asked.

Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images US news US repeating Covid mistakes with bird flu as spread raises alarm, experts say Public health experts warn ‘overinflated view of abilities’ and restrictive laws could make next outbreak more lethal Melody Schreiber Fri 30 Aug 2024 15.00 BST Last modified on Fri 30 Aug 2024 15.01 BST Share The US is making the same mistakes with the H5N1 bird flu virus as with Covid, even as the highly pathogenic avian influenza continues spreading on American farms and raising alarms that it could mutate to become a pandemic, public health experts argue in the New England Journal of Medicine. “We’re closing our eyes to both the Covid pandemic and to a potential nascent bird flu [pandemic] on the horizon,” said Gregg Gonsalves, associate professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health and co-author of the article. “Our ability to react swiftly and decisively is the big problem.” Beyond the outbreaks – of Covid, bird flu, mpox, measles and other dangerous pathogens – the inability or refusal to learn the lessons of each crisis is the most pressing health issue facing America, he said. “The social epidemic of forgetting is probably the more worrisome public health event of 2024.” A lack of testing, opaque data, political divides, poor healthcare access and a sense of hubris – all have plagued the Covid response, and now these errors are playing across the bird flu response, Gonsalves said. “We have not really done anything to address what’s happening in terms of the onward spread of bird flu across the US – we’re back to the same old mistakes,” he said. “Right now, the imminent risk is low and we haven’t seen human-to-human transmission. But the point is, we don’t wait for that to happen. Right?” US to survey dairy cattle brought to slaughter to study bird flu infections Read more Global officials have feared an H5N1 pandemic ever since the first case was detected among people in 1997. Highly pathogenic influenza viruses have been closely watched for decades because of their pandemic potential, and it was partly because of its monitoring for pandemic-potential pathogens like these that the US ranked No 1 for pandemic preparedness in 2019 . Yet when struck by a new respiratory virus, SARS-CoV-2, the US fared much worse than other countries in the global north, with at least 1.2 million deaths and millions more sickened and disabled by the virus. Experts are still unraveling the reasons why – and trying to draw attention to these failures before the next avoidable crisis. A lack of testing and monitoring of the virus plagued the Covid response, from the limited and faulty tests in the early days to the lack of testing that persisted. Similarly, scientists now know H5N1 circulated in cattle for months before being detected, and reporting indicates infections among farm workers may have gone unreported as well. Some employers at farms have been reluctant to cooperate with health officials – much like the meatpacking industry was with Covid, Gonsalves said. The confusing and byzantine structure of federal, state and local agency responsibility also creates significant challenges. Although there were calls for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be granted greater powers to lead federal responses to pandemics because of Covid, no such changes have been made. Agencies still struggle with jurisdiction and collaboration, and there are also substantial differences between federal, state and local approaches. With Covid, “we had a patchwork of state responses, some of which were more robust than others, and we paid for it”, Gonsalves said. The curbs on public health powers only worsened because of Covid. At least 26 states introduced new laws putting limits on public health authorities during the pandemic. Iowa and Tennessee, for example, now prohibit mask requirements in schools, and health officials can’t close schools in Wisconsin. That’s deeply troubling because the next pandemic could greatly affect school-aged children, which has been true of influenza historically, Gonsalves said. “We’re fixated on what just happened, not having any sort of imagination of what a new pandemic could bring.” The next pandemic virus could spread even faster and be even more lethal – and that’s true even if the virus itself isn’t more virulent, because of the lack of funding for, trust in, and authority of public health, he said. Recent decisions from the US supreme court, including invoking the “major questions” doctrine and overturning the Chevron precedent , mean federal agencies would likely need explicit permission from Congress, which can be divided and slow to act, to take quick action and stem new outbreaks. “We’re basically being told, ‘Ignore what just happened over the past four-plus years, ignore what’s happening now with bird flu, and let’s tie your hands behind your backs in terms of being able to respond when the time comes,’” Gonsalves said. Political fractures only worsened during the Covid pandemic and threaten to derail efforts to contain outbreaks of infectious diseases. Growing anti-vaccine sentiment could block the development and distribution of new and existing pharmaceuticals, like vaccines, once they have gone through the complicated and expensive process of development. Operation Warp Speed, a massive and successful project to produce Covid vaccines quickly, wound down instead of becoming a regular fixture in pandemic response. Inequities have hampered vaccine distribution even now . “We have a fractured healthcare system, which means if you can’t get a vaccine because you don’t have insurance right now, you’re shit out of luck,” Gonsalves said. Those who can afford it may access quality health care in the US, but serious gaps remain for those who are uninsured or under-insured. The US health system has “the most fancy tertiary care in the world”, he said, but it stumbles on primary care, preventive medicine and public health. “We’re not good at the basics.” Vast inequality meant some patients were able to access some of the most sophisticated care in the world while others struggled to find enough masks, ventilators and treatments. While other countries softened the worst of the pandemic’s blows with social safety nets, many Americans were left to fend for themselves, Gonsalves said. And the focus on individual health overlooks the role of public health, which is collective by definition. Despite these fatal missteps, the US has never had a Covid commission to analyze what went wrong, as countries like the UK have done. There was a bipartisan effort to create an inquiry similar to the 9/11 Commission, but it fizzled. It was America’s sense of misplaced and persistent confidence that it was handling the pandemic as well as possible that perhaps most damaged its response, Gonsalves said. “We have a vastly overinflated view of our abilities, capacities and willingness to do the right thing.” Officials have reiterated, for instance, that “we have the tools” – yet treatments and vaccines quickly become outdated as the virus evolves, while access issues and misinformation persist and other precautions, like isolating for the duration of illness, are no longer recommended. There’s still time to correct these mistakes, the experts said. “Everybody is exceedingly grateful that we are not stuck in a loop of 2020, in which our hospitals were overflowing, morgues were overflowing and we had no recourse against the virus,” Gonsalves said. But “we can do a lot more”, from updating respiratory virus guidance with the latest evidence on transmission to improving indoor air quality. The Covid pandemic has been “one of the most important historical events in the United States in the past 100 years, in terms of public health. We’ve all suffered,” Gonsalves said. “The best way to avoid the pain that we’ve felt in the past four years is being prepared.” Explore more on these topics US news Bird flu Coronavirus Health Infectious diseases news Share Reuse this content Most viewed Most viewed World Europe US Americas Asia Australia Middle East Africa Inequality Global development News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email About us Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Modern Slavery Act Tax strategy Digital newspaper archive Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn X Newsletters Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Patrons Back to top © 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Martha Gill We’re warned not to assign human qualities to other species, but evidence of their complex abilities is mounting Supported by About this content Sat 7 Sep 2024 17.00 BST Last modified on Sat 7 Sep 2024 21.08 BST Share T he details differ, but really it’s the same story, turning up every few weeks, for around a decade now. The revelation – and it’s always presented with a dramatic flourish – is this: animals are much more like us than we thought. Last week, it was that dogs could remember the names of their old toys – even when they hadn’t seen them for two years. Language acquisition, that “uniquely human” thing, was being encroached on, the researchers said: dogs could store words in their memory. Last month, it was that horses could strategise and plan ahead , overturning the assumption that they “simply respond to stimuli in the moment”. And in April, it was that there’s a “ realistic possibility of consciousness” in reptiles, fish and even insects – according to a declaration signed by some 40 scientists. One of the studies backing the claims recorded bumblebees playing with wooden balls. The behaviour had no obvious connection to mating or survival, the authors thought. It was for fun. The mental territory we can claim to be “uniquely human” is shrinking at an alarming rate. Wasps can distinguish faces, dolphins call one another by name, pigs use tools, zebra finches dream, parrots go on Zoom, and sometimes crayfish get anxious. Chimps, meanwhile, exist in complex cultures, rather like ours, with fashion trends. In one recorded instance, a high-ranking female chimp started wearing grass in her ears . Within a week, all the female chimps were doing it. Does this seem obvious? It did to Darwin, who, along with other naturalists, once assumed that animals, like us, were individuals with some form of consciousness. “Can we feel sure that an old dog with an excellent memory and some power of imagination, as shewn by his dreams, never reflects on his past pleasures of the chase?” he wrote in The Descent of Man . But Darwin’s successors were more sceptical, and at the start of the 20th century came a chorus of demands for hard evidence for this point of view. Opinion changed, and “anthropomorphism” became a sin in the natural sciences. For many scientists, it is still a word that means you’ve made a mistake – you’re guilty of sentimentality and intellectual failure. This piece of wisdom has filtered outwards from academia to policymaking, and to the general public. The idea that assigning human motivation to animals is a stupid thing to do is deeply ingrained in us. In a recent article in Psychology Today , the author frets that children are being taught to anthropomorphise , which he takes for granted is an error. The British government only recognised animal sentience in law in 2021. But the more we find out about our fellow creatures, the more the evidence is swinging behind devoted dog owners, Beatrix Potter readers and Disney aficionados. We might in fact be guilty of the opposite bias – stubbornly looking the other way as animals demonstrate guilt, pain, happiness and theory of mind; of overestimating ourselves and underestimating the rest of the animal kingdom. It’s revealing of scientific culture that this bias doesn’t have a common name. But the late primatologist Frans de Waal called it “anthropodenialism”. If so, it’s an important mistake to correct. First, because there’s an obvious link between cruelty and the belief that your victims are not, like you, capable of deep suffering. It wasn’t until 1987 that the medical profession recognised that newborns could feel pain (they couldn’t tell us after all). So babies were regularly operated on without anaesthetics or any type of sedation. Mothers recorded evidence of trauma in later life – these children would shake and vomit when visiting a hospital. De Waal has discussed a mid-20th-century experiment where chimps were denied food, but the staff at the primate centre rebelled and started feeding the animals in secret. The lead scientist bemoaned his “tender-hearted colleagues” for failing to “reduce chimpanzees to a satisfactory state of deprivation”. If animals are more like us, it’s worth knowing – especially for those campaigning in their favour. When naturalists trying to protect elephant herds from hunters shifted from raw statistics and aerial photographs to creating elephant “celebrities” – with biographies and photographed in high-fashion style portraits – support flooded in. Kindness to animals, it seems, is often conditional on recognising that they are similar to us . Anthropomorphism has its limits. The eccentric biologist George Romanes, who studied under Darwin, claimed to have recorded a group of rooks putting a jackdaw on trial, and a pet snake that had died of shock after his owner fell ill. Humans anthropomorphise compulsively – we’re capable of assigning human motives to practically anything – a cloud, a missing pencil, a stubborn door. The job of science is to treat such instincts with scepticism, and to proceed only on the basis on evidence. But the evidence is mounting in the other direction. Which might be why biologists become more, rather than less, likely to anthropomorphise their subjects as they gain experience. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We end up empathising only with the animals we know well, such as our pets. At the height on anthropodenialism, in the 19th century, experiments on dogs triggered huge protests by anti-cruelty leagues, but the fate of other animals attracted little interest. This hierarchy of cuteness persists. We have a surfeit of laws against pet cruelty, but continue to treat farm animals badly. Earlier this year, footage at a Devon farm showed pigs kept in filthy conditions with untreated wounds, reduced to cannibalism to survive. Last month, the BBC found a rise in “ megafarms ”, where cows can be kept indoors for the whole of their lives. It’s not just dogs and cats that deserve our empathy.

I can’t wait Eva Wiseman With a biologically significant birthday looming, it’s time to take stock – and get ready to embrace whatever comes next Sun 1 Sep 2024 08.30 BST Last modified on Sun 1 Sep 2024 12.32 BST Share R ecently I’ve been going through old photographs. My parents are clearing out their loft and I’ve been forced, finally, to confront the boxes of A-level sketchbooks and towers of 90s magazines, and let it all go. The photographs, though, are interesting. It’s a cliché, I know, to look back at images of youth and tut at how lovely you were, and how blind to that loveliness you were at the time. But it still shocks me to look at a photo from my teens, covered in black eyeliner at a family seder night, or awkwardly leaning against the stairs in a 50s dress and 80s shoes, and feel that maternal tug towards my old self, and the memory of just how foolish and monstrous I believed myself to be. This autumn I will turn 44, an age (new research suggests) of “dramatic change”. The study tracked thousands of molecules in people aged 25 to 75, and detected two major waves of age-related changes, first at 44 and then again at 60. When I read this, I got up from my seat and stood for a little while in front of the mirror. I looked at my jawline and thought about ageing. Youth sometimes feels like a party I went to but was too anxious to actually enjoy. There’s proof I was there, both in photographs and the long, yellow fact of time, but my only memory of it exists as a kind of glanced reflection, or the fleeting smell of perfume. Inspecting the creases beside my eyes I had the weary thought that I should be revelling in this relative youth today, as next year I would no doubt look back at this person with some sad wonder. But just as it’s hard to appreciate youth when living it, it’s even trickier, isn’t it, to embrace age? You can try, and the trying is worthwhile, but the stories we’ve been told about ageing – they’re not good! And I’m not just talking about appearance, about the frantic race to burnish, inject and stretch one’s face into an illusion of youth, but this is an illustration of the problem. Why would anyone want to look 50 when we don’t know what 50 is for? Why would anyone allow themselves to look 70 when to be 70 is to be at best invisible, at worst repellent? We have very little idea of what the alternative to youth could look like for a woman. Youth is not just linked to femininity; the two, we learn quickly, are mashed together, squeezed until you can’t really tell where one ends and the other begins. There is little imagination lent to stories about a woman getting older. After the first stories we are told about the shape of a life, the falling in love, the leaving home, the marriage, the children, what next, beyond maybe shame, loss, grief and a little light humiliation? Once you start questioning this absence of stories, it makes you wonder why – why are we women told to expect so little from the second part of our lives? Could it be (and I do try not to overuse this word for fear of it losing its meaning, but), could it be: the patriarchy? If more women were vocal and in power, would the transition from young to old be granted more texture and excitement? If we were told stories that taught us how a life beyond middle age included new joys – a new kind of sexuality, and wisdom and beauty, would it be seen as something even to look forward to? As I get older, and closer, too, to 44, that moment of dramatic change (I am half expecting a bell to ring, a curtain to fall), I find myself scrabbling around for such stories. But what’s also happening is that younger women are asking me for advice, and I find I am able to tell them. And not only do the stories hopefully lubricate these women’s passage towards middle age, but in telling them, I’m seeing things differently. For instance, a pregnant friend is wavering over a planned C section, and asked me about the reality of labour pain. How bad is it, she wanted to know. And I thought, and I said, yes, it’s real pain, mad weird profound pain, but – it’s also… fascinating? Partly in that you see what your body can do and partly that you see what it can endure, and it changes you. On my way home I thought, perhaps this is the way with the painful experiences associated with old age, too; perhaps they also contain similar hidden miracles that give you power and insight. Last week, it was reported that the world’s oldest living person, Maria Branyas Morera , had died at the age of 117 years and 168 days. She appears to have lived a great life, right up until the end. One of the things she attributed her longevity to was, “staying away from toxic people”, which is, of course, fabulous advice, but, “I think longevity is also about being lucky,” she added. I’m not wildly interested in living to 117, but if I come close, I hope I learn how to avoid romanticising youth, how to enjoy the luck of health and how to properly embrace all the freedom and adventures that old age might bring.

Photograph: Jörg Böthling/Alamy Opinion Access to water The solar pump revolution could bring water to millions of Africans but it must be sustainable and fair Alan MacDonald Solar power could enable 400 million Africans without water to tap into groundwater aquifers. However, we must ensure smaller projects do not lose out in the rush for new technology Supported by About this content Mon 9 Sep 2024 11.00 BST Last modified on Mon 9 Sep 2024 12.09 BST Share I t’s a truly dreadful irony: for many of the 400 million people in sub-Saharan Africa who lack access to even a basic water supply, there is likely to be a significant reserve in aquifers sitting just a few metres below their feet. Groundwater – the water stored in small spaces and fractures in rocks – makes up nearly 99% of all of the unfrozen fresh water on the planet. Across the African continent, the volume of water stored underground is estimated to be 20 times the amount held in lakes and reservoirs. The opportunity that groundwater presents for increasing access to water is widely recognised, with more than half of the global population already believed to be relying on it for drinking water. When you add the ability of solar energy to power the necessary infrastructure and the fact that groundwater supplies are much more resilient than surface water during drought, the potential for harnessing this water source to provide a clean and regular supply to communities in chronic need comes into focus. With the ability to pump large volumes of water comes the possibility of overexploiting and depleting groundwater resources The opportunity presented by solar technology for increasing groundwater pumping for drinking and irrigation will be discussed this week at the International Association of Hydrogeologists’ (IAH) World Groundwater Congress in Davos, Switzerland. Much of the debate centres on how to best deploy this increasingly affordable solar technology to unlock groundwater potential; not just in terms of drinking water, but also in terms of irrigating crops – unleashing the ability to address both water and food insecurity without the need for fossil fuels. The IAH congress comes at a time when the ability to map groundwater availability across the continent has never been greater. New understanding of African geology is helping local hydrogeologists predict which areas have the most potential for solar pumps and new, easy-to-use technology is being developed to help better assess the quality of groundwater. Communities are helping determine the most sustainable management models for water supply, while donors and governments are taking increasing interest in the quality of rural supply chains. Momentum is building, and with it comes the chance to deliver meaningful, lifesaving change. The fly in the ointment, however, is the complexity that comes from moving the hypothetical into the real world. There are two issues that will need to be at the centre of the discussions in Davos if we are to secure a sustainable route forward. View image in fullscreen A drip-irrigation scheme in Lodwar, near Lake Turkana, Kenya. Photograph: Jörg Böthling/Alamy First is the potential for overuse. With the ability to pump large volumes of water comes the possibility of overexploiting and depleting groundwater resources. This is a significant point of concern across parts of Asia, the Middle East and the US . Second, we must not lose sight of the geological and environmental limitations of the technology to benefit fully from this opportunity. The ability to reach all parts of the region does not yet exist: about 30% of Africa’s rural population live on ancient rocks that may not be able to support the higher pumping rates demanded by large solar pumps. A recent study by the organisation I work for, the British Geological Survey, alongside partners from Paris-Saclay University, showed that geology was the key limiting factor to solar pumping, not the availability of sunshine. It is essential that a focus on solar pumps does not distract attention from the most vulnerable communities I will be calling for caution among those who see this solar-pumping revolution as a panacea – those who are focusing solely on the installation of large-scale systems that extract large volumes of groundwater that can then be piped directly to homes or to the farmers that need it. Such programmes can provide a balance between investment and impact, and as such they are attracting increasing interest and financial backing. So they should, as when they work they will change the lives of many millions of people. However, alongside the big projects, there should continue to be investment in small-scale use of groundwater for rural water supply, and for technologies such as handpumps or low-yielding solar-powered pumps that are more appropriate for the geology. These smaller pumps could improve access to water for rural communities while providing additional safeguards against overuse by matching pumping rates to the geology. Where the geology is complex and yields from wells are low, small solar systems can pump throughout the day and store the water for domestic or productive use when it is actually needed. Greening the desert: is Sisi’s grand plan using up all of Egypt’s water? Read more We should measure our success in combining the power of solar technology with groundwater not in terms of people helped, but in those left behind. This approach would help focus our minds on a comprehensive solution – securing sustainable solutions that enhance access to clean drinking water for all. Technological breakthroughs are exciting and progress is exhilarating. But it is essential that a focus on solar pumps does not distract attention from the most marginalised and vulnerable communities. I would invite everyone to see this “solar groundwater pumping revolution” in terms of equity. Through that lens, we have the chance to ensure that this precious resource is sustainably and fairly unlocked to all those who are still waiting for a safe and reliable water supply.

Photograph: Damien Eagers/PA The Breakdown newsletter Rugby union Why a British-Irish league would not be the panacea rugby needs Let’s be brutally frank – how much would a so-called Super League really shift the dial without emotional investment? Robert Kitson Tue 17 Sep 2024 11.23 BST Last modified on Tue 17 Sep 2024 14.39 BST Share I n a perfect world the countdown to a new season would be all about the rugby. Can Northampton Saints and Glasgow Warriors successfully defend their hard-earned respective Premiership and United Rugby Championship titles? If not, who will be their biggest threats? And which individuals have the ability to exchange relative anonymity for a place in Andy Farrell’s British & Irish Lions squad next summer? The weather is half-decent, the pitches firm, the scent of freshly cut grass and embrocation reliably evocative. There is just one sizeable drawback, as every professional club executive can testify. Primarily, it is all about the price tag and whether or not the sums stack up. Out in the real world it is less a case of smelling the Deep Heat than absorbing the financial pain. Premiership gears up for new season with battle for eyeballs never greater Read more If anyone needed proof it came late last week. An eve-of-season board meeting would usually be about dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s to ensure the best chance of a shiny, happy campaign. Instead, the Premiership’s power brokers have been debating whether or not a British & Irish men’s league may be a better way forward. Efforts have since been made to pour cold water on the story but there is rarely smoke in rugby without some glowing embers. Well-placed insiders have been offering up a simple three-letter explanation: CVC. In normal circumstances, the private equity company that splashed so much cash for the privilege of investing in rugby union six years ago would now be poised to check out. It did not get involved to chat endlessly about scrums and mauls; the chief priority is a significant return on that investment. As things stand, that has yet to materialise. Recently, even the supposed pinnacle of the club game, the Champions Cup, has failed to tempt England’s most established broadcasters. Good luck to Premier Sports but awarding it the rights does not obviously solve the competition’s steady slippage in profile. And what happens if Sky, TNT Sports, Discovery and the terrestrial channels decide they can do without the expense of cross-border club rugby indefinitely? Little wonder the Premiership’s next television contract, once TNT’s deal expires in 2026, is already concentrating minds. There is one twinkling solution in clear view. A bespoke rugby channel, broadcasting all the best club games worldwide, with millions of subscribers keen to register. CVC, which has stakes in the Premiership and the URC, would be ignoring the marketing elephant in the room if it did not at least float the idea of a simplified offering. “Sign up for the best league in the world” – even more competitive on a weekly basis than the Top 14 – would be a useful tagline. All of which fuels the British & Irish League speculation. Twenty-five years ago, in the earliest days of professionalism, it would have made even more sense. Work together to stabilise the player wage “arms race”, dovetail the fixture list with the Five/Six Nations and save several decades of angst? Hurrah! These days things are far more logistically tangled and complex. View image in fullscreen Glasgow Warriors begin the defence of their URC title on Saturday. Photograph: Steve Haag Sports/Inpho/Shutterstock Let’s be brutally frank. Would any resultant “Super League” be a massive improvement or shift the dial in terms of its financial uplift? Compared with the increasingly buoyant and eye-catching Top 14, Newcastle v Dragons or Connacht v Sale on a Friday night would hardly be a gamechanger. A conference set-up works in American sport but would it capture neutral imaginations here? And what about the South Africans and the Italians, both of whom are being sworn in as full voting partners of the URC next year? Speaking to representatives of both leagues this week, there is certainly little sense of breathless excitement or talk of a magic bullet. Unless, maybe, the various national unions could all be persuaded that the still-lucrative Six Nations – particularly in the event of the old European Cup faltering – would be stronger as a result. Then, maybe, there could be a virtuous circle: the fixture list would dovetail more effectively, the best players would play in bigger and better club games and those who only watch the international game could be more easily enticed. For that to happen, though, a deft scalpel will have to be applied to both existing leagues. If the broadcasters are ever going to be persuaded to pay top dollar again in an uncertain market, they will want to be showcasing the best players on the continent, not also-ran sides full of journeymen. Some of the scenarios being discussed would also involve eight English sides. In that event, which two would drop out? AOn that subject, how many competitive men’s professional sides can Wales sustain? Enough. History has long since taught us that self-interest is rugby officialdom’s guiding light. This instantly renders the idea of an Anglo-Welsh league – which would benefit relatively few and dilute everyone’s share of the central pie – a non-starter for the English and makes a British & Irish league similarly unlikely for the foreseeable future. Admittedly, there has been some tentative interest from Ireland but, ultimately, the lessons of rugby’s past echo loudest. Without an intense whiff of historic rivalry and, ideally, fervent away support, no amount of televisual magic will generate the same emotional pull. Which is why, as the Prem and the URC prepare to kick off on Friday night with Bath hosting Northampton in a repeat of last season’s final and Edinburgh entertaining their old rivals Leinster, we should all be extremely careful what we wish for.

Chiles, with the support of the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee and USA Gymnastics , filed the appeal on Monday. Jordan Chiles’s bronze medal saga has inflicted needless suffering on innocent gymnasts Read more Chiles was initially given the bronze in Paris after an appeal over how the judges scored her routine was accepted and she moved up from fifth to third place. However, the Romanian Olympic Committee said the appeal had been filed four seconds after the one-minute time limit. Cas then voided Chiles’s appeal and the IOC ordered the American to return the medal . Romania’s Ana Barbosu was promoted to third while Chiles dropped back to fifth. The 23-year-old American received significant abuse on social media, some of it racist. Chiles’s appeal maintains that the Cas hearing violated her “right to be heard” by refusing to allow video evidence that Chiles and USA Gymnastics believe showed Chiles’s appeal in Paris was within the one-minute limit. Chiles’ appeal also argues that Hamid G Gharavi, president of the Cas panel, has a conflict of interest due to past legal ties to Romania . USA Gymnastics wrote in a statement on Monday night that it made a “collective, strategic decision to have Jordan lead the initial filing. USAG is closely coordinating with Jordan and her legal team and will make supportive filings with the court in the continued pursuit of justice for Jordan.” The appeal is the next step in what could be a months- or years-long legal battle. Last week, Chiles spoke about the emotional fallout after she was stripped of the bronze. “The biggest thing that was taken from me was, it was the recognition of who I was. Not just my sport, but the person I am,” she said. Chiles said that being punished despite following procedures had been hard to process. “I followed the rules. My coach followed the rules. We did everything that was totally, completely right,” Chiles said. The fallout from the saga also tarnished what had been a touching moment at the medal ceremony where Chiles was initially awarded bronze. Chiles and her US teammate, Simone Biles, knelt to honor Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade, who won gold in the event. It had been the first time in the Olympic floor exercise that all three medalists were Black.

Liverpool begin their campaign for a seventh European Cup against Milan at San Siro on Tuesday night. While Alisson admitted he was eager to play in the world’s leading club competition again after a season in the Europa League, he also sounded a warning for the future of the sport unless administrators start listening to players’ concerns over the schedule. The 2024-25 Champions League is the first to be run under the “Swiss system”, in which each team play eight matches in a group phase that will not finish until late January. “I think for the supporters it’s amazing,” Alisson said. “More games, bigger games, big teams playing against each other. For us as players, it’s always a good idea to add some games to a calendar that is not busy. I am being ironic a little bit. The Champions League: a new dawn, or just the richest winning in more lucrative ways? Read more “Nobody asks the players what they think about adding more games, so maybe our opinion doesn’t matter. But everyone knows what we think about having more games. Everybody is tired of that. But we have to stay focused on the big challenge that we have tomorrow.” The Brazilian missed large parts of last season because of injury, but in previous seasons has played more than 60 games when international commitments and pre-season tours are taken into account. Asked to suggest a more appropriate workload, Alisson declined to offer a figure, but argued that competition organisers had a duty of care to the stars of the spectacle. View image in fullscreen Arne Slot speaks to his players in the buildup to their match in Italy. Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA “We understand we have the media side, the TV. We have Uefa, Fifa, the Premier League, the domestic competitions. We are not stupid, we understand that people want more games. But the reasonable thing would be for all the people responsible for organising the calendar to sit together and listen to all the parts, including the players. We just need to be listened to, and understand the thinking behind the direction that football wants to go. Not only adding games, adding competitions, adding this, adding that. “At the end, all we want is to give our best. If you are tired, you cannot compete at a high level. What I want is to give the best in all the games that I play. But we need a solution, and it doesn’t look like we are close to a good solution for football’s sake and the players’ sake.” Arne Slot, by contrast, was prepared to withhold judgement on the competition changes until he had seen how they worked in practice. And in any case, the Liverpool coach has more pressing concerns to deal with. The game in Milan comes just three days after the abject 1-0 home defeat against Nottingham Forest at the weekend, a game from which the Dutchman was determined to learn the right lessons. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Miami has a large Haitian community, many of them based in the neighbourhood of Little Haiti. The widely debunked lies around the Haitian community in Ohio were amplified when they were repeated by Donald Trump during his television debate with Kamal Harris last week. “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs, the people that came in, they’re eating the cats,” said Trump. “They’re eating the pets of the people that live there.” David Muir, one of ABC’s moderators for the debate, quickly corrected the former president. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines US Free newsletter Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

More than a century ago, in June 1899, Arthur Richardson left Perth to ride the circumference of the Australian continent. He returned 245 days later. Richardson’s epic journey was part of a movement of long-distance cycling, known as “the Overlanders”, which flourished at the turn of the century. In the 125 years since, dozens of Australians have attempted to ride around the country. The current record stands at 37 days, 20 hours and 45 minutes, set by Queenslander David Alley in 2011. But almost two weeks into his own quest, Morton – who rides for professional team EF Education–EasyPost – is on track to blitz that time. “It’s good,” he tells Guardian Australia by phone during a brief rest stop. “Tough, obviously. But we’re having a good time.” View image in fullscreen Morton is followed by a support crew in a caravan and is tracking his journey online. Photograph: Karter Machen/EF Education-EasyPost The 32-year-old set off from his home town of Port Macquarie earlier this month. Last weekend, he reached Darwin (his progress can be followed via an online tracker ). By Tuesday he had passed Kununurra and was heading south-west towards Broome – almost 6,000km into the journey. ‘A tiny ant crawling on a map’: Lael Wilcox on her epic cycle from Perth to Brisbane Read more The rules for official attempts around Australia provide that cyclists must cover at least 14,200km and pass through eight locations: Sydney, Brisbane, Darwin, Broome, Perth, Esperance, Adelaide and Melbourne. Otherwise, riders can set their own route – although they typically ride anti-clockwise, to take advantage of prevailing tailwinds. Last year, Lesa Ashford became the first woman to complete the lap. Morton was a promising road cyclist in his early career and rode for several years on the World Tour, winning the Tour of Utah and contesting the Vuelta a España and Giro d’Italia. But the Australian has always had an adventurous streak. In 2014, Morton and his brother Angus rode from Port Macquarie to Uluru – a 2,500km ride – and turned the journey into a documentary, Thereabouts . It was a hit within the cycling world, and led to equivalent documented rides around the world. View image in fullscreen Morton’s route takes in 44,000 metres of elevation – much of it to come in the weeks ahead. Photograph: EF Education-EasyPost “It’s wildly different,” Morton says of his switch from racing to these long-distance epics. “This is such an individual and mental thing. The demands on the body in doing something like this are far greater. You have to be able to push yourself when things are less than ideal – whereas in a professional environment, everything is set up to be quite ideal. “You’re sharing the road with someone who might be going to work, or is at work,” he says. “The real world is going on around you. I think I prefer this kind of thing, to be honest.” Morton says he is trying to take “the day as it comes at you”. He is sleeping about seven hours in the afternoon and evening, before leaving in the early hours and riding through the night. Morton is followed by a support crew in a caravan; they typically join him for breakfast after daybreak, before the rider powers on (his biggest day saw the cyclist cover almost 600km). “Once I’m done I try to relax, kick back for an hour with the crew, maybe grab a beer,” he says. “And then I’m off to bed, doing it all again in the morning. “The morning comes quick,” Morton concedes. “It’s a lot of pedalling, mate.” View image in fullscreen ‘It’s an incredible way to get a real feel for the country,’ Morton says. Photograph: Karter Machen/EF Education-EasyPost Morton is raising funds for the Indigenous Literacy Foundation (supporters have already donated over $30,000). He says he chose the charity after planning the route and appreciating the challenges of travelling through such remote areas. “It felt fitting to work with an organisation that is helping kids deal with those unique challenges,” he says. “Everyone deserves to have access to a good education – and books are the basic cornerstone of that.” If he keeps up his present pace, Morton will have no difficulty breaking the record. But he is likely to contend with more challenges, and much of the route’s 44,000 metres of elevation, in the weeks ahead. Perhaps epitomising the distinctly Australian nature of Morton’s odyssey, he collided with some local wildlife near Mt Isa. “I fully hit a kangaroo,” he chuckles. “I was on top of it before I’d even noticed it. I felt for sure I was about to have a big crash. But he was all right, and I was all right.” As he rides, Morton sometimes listens to music or podcasts. But he says he spends most of the time just soaking in the scenery. “It’s an incredible way to get a real feel for the country,” says Morton. “You’re travelling over it with your own power. You feel every hill, you feel the burn of the sun, you notice the wind. All these things that you don’t get if you travel in other ways.” Explore more on these topics Cycling Australia sport Cycling holidays features Share Reuse this content Comments (…) Sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion Most viewed Most viewed Football Cricket Rugby union Tennis Cycling F1 Golf Boxing Rugby league Racing US sports News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email About us Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Modern Slavery Act Tax strategy Digital newspaper archive Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn X Newsletters Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Patrons Back to top © 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Joining seven-time Super Bowl champion and Blues minority owner Tom Brady and Wrexham co-owner Rob McElhenney in the stands was the former England captain David Beckham and his son Romeo, who saw Jack Marriott’s early opener silence the home supporters before Stansfield fired home a rebound to level on his first league start in front of 27,980 fans. Much was made of Stansfield’s move from Fulham for a reported £15m fee but it paid dividends when he headed Birmingham in front with a second early in the second half. Tomoki Iwata’s stunner helped seal the points before Krystian Bielik was sent off late in the piece. View image in fullscreen Birmingham’s £15m man Jay Stansfield celebrates the first of his two goals against Wrexham. Photograph: Paul Currie/Colorsport/Shutterstock Wrexham took an early lead – Tom O’Connor’s inswinging corner caused carnage under the crossbar and Bailey Peacock-Farrell punched out to Marriott who powered home. But the visitors were unable to keep a fifth consecutive clean sheet as Alfie May’s initial effort stung the palms of Arthur Okonkwo and the ball fell to Stansfield who struck in the rebound. Birmingham turned the game on its head thanks largely to a spectacular cross from Alex Cochrane which picked out the head of Stansfield and he nodded home for his second of the night. The hosts had breathing space in the 59th minute as Iwata let fly with a thunderbolt from 25 yards which flew past Okonkwo to make it 3-1. Things started to spill over after Paul Mullin appeared to get up close and personal with Alex Cochrane’s leg – sparking a large brawl, with James McClean front and centre. The former West Brom man was immediately taken off, receiving a loud response from the Birmingham faithful.

Blues are now level on 13 points with leaders Wrexham. Blues boss Chris Davies insists he did not pay attention to the pre-match hype ahead of kick-off and applauded his players for keeping their focus purely on the football. “We weren’t paying attention to that sort of stuff,” he said. “It’s something I did address with the players that this is going on but that’s not our domain, ours is the pitch, what we do and the performance, external stuff is irrelevant to us. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Photosport/INPHO/Shutterstock England rugby union team Steve Borthwick homes in on new England defence coach Post vacant after shock resignation of Jones Laker, Gustard and El-Abd all in contention Gerard Meagher Mon 16 Sep 2024 20.15 BST Last modified on Mon 16 Sep 2024 22.34 BST Share Steve Borthwick is closing in on a new defence coach as he moves to restore order to his ranks following the shock resignation of Felix Jones . The South African coach Norman Laker is believed to be in the frame while Paul Gustard has also emerged as a candidate along with Joe El-Abd as Borthwick seeks to bolster his staff following a summer of upheaval. The former England No 8 Nick Easter has also been linked with the role, but it is understood that ­Borthwick’s appointment is expected to be one of the aforementioned three candidates. Laker, who holds the role with the Stormers of Cape Town, would be the continuity candidate given he has developed a reputation for ­aggressive linespeed. His contract with the Stormers runs to 2027 but it is said he has an escape clause should he be offered an international position. Like Jones he has previously worked with the former South Africa head coach Jacques Nienaber. Tom Curry: ‘The surgeon said you are probably going to retire … I just cried’ Read more Gustard occupied the role for the first two-and-a-half years under Eddie Jones before moving to take over at ­Harlequins. But his stint at the Stoop was ill-fated – he left in January 2021 and five months later Quins were crowned champions – but he has been ­restoring his reputation as defence coach with Treviso and now Stade Français. El-Abd is close to Borthwick and has been employed as head coach at Oyonnax – who are in the second tier in France – for the past five years. In his playing days, El-Abd made more than 100 appearances for Bristol before moving to France. According to the BBC, Borthwick has spoken to the three candidates while it is understood that the head coach hopes to have secured his man before England’s autumn internationals campaign with New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and Japan coming to Twickenham in November. It is also understood that whether the successful candidate is available to start work during the autumn or is required to work notice will dictate whether Jones – who has a 12-month notice period – remains in position for the November Tests. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Breakdown Free weekly newsletter The latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No Briton has held the presidency since the IOC was formed in 1894. Sebastian Coe faces a fight to become IOC president – but write him off at your peril | Sean Ingle Read more But Coe, whose CV also includes being a double Olympic gold medallist and running the London 2012 Games , will face a tough challenge from a field that includes a Jordanian prince, a seven-time Olympian, and the well-connected son of a former IOC president. The global leaders of cycling, gymnastics and skiing have also put their names forward for the job of replacing Thomas Bach when he steps down next year. Like most major sporting organisations, the IOC faces a number of challenges, including needing to renegotiate multimillion-dollar TV deals in a rapidly changing media landscape, find new sponsors, and find ways to stay relevant with younger viewers. In a statement, Coe outlined the qualities he believes can attract a majority of the IOC’s 111 members to vote for him next March. “Olympic sport is fundamental to my DNA,” he wrote. “I had the privilege of being a double Olympic Champion, I’ve chaired an Olympic and Paralympic Games – London 2012 – from bid, through delivery and legacy implementation, I’ve chaired a National Olympic Committee – the BOA – and I’ve led an international federation through some turbulent times, retaining athletics’ position as a cornerstone of the Olympic Games.” Coe also promised to invest more into sports organisations and to help people get fitter. “Sport plays a critical role in driving and maintaining the health and fitness of people, young and old, in every country around the world. But it faces significant challenges on multiple fronts,” he wrote. “The Covid years saw many people struggle through inactivity and many sports organisations suffer through lack of funds. We need to invest more in both over the next decade. A laser-like focus on sport must be the priority for the IOC. I believe I can help achieve this and more.” There had been suggestions that the 67-year-old Coe could be too old for the top job under the IOC’s opaque rules which require some members to step down at 70. However on Monday the IOC confirmed that was not the case and he could apply for a four-year age extension in 2026. But while Coe is one of the favourites, his path to the top job has been made harder having fallen out with Bach over the decision of World Athletics to ban Russia for state-sponsored doping. Bach is expected to throw his weight behind Kirsty Coventry, the former Zimbabwean swimmer who is bidding to become the first woman to become IOC president. A bigger challenge still could come from the Spaniard Juan Antonio Samaranch, the IOC’s well-connected and respected vice-president, whose father was president from 1982 to 2001. In a statement, Samaranch insisted that his candidacy was “built on a commitment to continue the legacy” of Bach in a time of uncertainty and change. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Recap Free weekly newsletter The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He sits down to give chapter and verse on his brush with retirement, the debilitating hip injury that required six-hour surgery and his gruelling recovery with an openness you would not always associate with one of rugby’s most intense operators. He soon speaks of the five stages of grief and, after 45 minutes in his company, it is clear that Curry has reached acceptance. To recap, Curry was feeling discomfort in his hip towards the back end of England’s World Cup campaign last year. It did not take long after returning to Sale to discover that “something wasn’t right” and the subsequent scan delivered a prognosis that floored him. “I had a Zoom with the surgeon and he said you are probably going to retire,” says Curry, still just 26.

You are limping around, you have retirement in your head and you’re being useless to everyone.” The road to recovery was a slog and went via Loughborough where Curry had to “learn to run again” before he could even think about returning to the field. “It’s the day-to-day stuff, like being able to go for a dog walk and not limping. That’s the big relief, those small tasks, because I was almost getting into a habit of limping. The biggest physical barrier was just to get running again and almost walking, just to get off the crutches, trusting your hip. “I tried to get back running, did partial weight-bearing, walking, all the rehab stuff, and then I tried to run and I couldn’t. That was a really tough period but once I got to Loughborough it genuinely taught me to run again. And that’s when the relief came. I saw the surgeon again, he said: ‘My biggest worry was getting you back, this conversation is how we can make you better as a rugby player.’” Curry eventually fought his way back to appear in Sale’s last match of the season against Bath, before he was taken on tour with England, coming off the bench in all three Tests. Against Bath, shortly after being introduced to the field he made a thunderous tackle on Josh Bayliss, 110kg of catharsis launched into the Scotland flanker’s ribs. “You get so pent up,” Curry says. “You are just like: ‘Let me just go.’” View image in fullscreen Curry taking part in England training in June. Photograph: Adam Davy/PA The irony of Curry’s plight is that the same all-or-nothing attitude which got him into trouble ultimately dug him out of it. He and Sam Underhill were dubbed the “Kamikaze Kids” by Eddie Jones because “they’ve got no care for their bodies”. Whether it be in the gym, on the training field or in thick of things on the pitch, Curry has always pushed himself to the limit and beyond. He has often struck as someone who knows no other way and he speaks of a newfound maturity in having to recalibrate his approach. “You have to drop a lot of ego,” he says. As his Sale director of rugby Alex Sanderson puts it: “Due to his personality, pushing the boat out too far in every session and every game, his ability to go after everything with everything he’s got was to some degree breaking his body apart. He’s had to come to that acceptance and understanding while he’s been rehabbing and looking at the rest of his career. I’ve enjoyed that with him, he’s matured as a person.” Listen to Curry’s dedication to rehab, however, and his single-mindedness is the reason he has made a successful return. “I don’t understand when people say: ‘I gained a hobby when I was injured, I learned something.’ Honestly I couldn’t think of anything worse. I’d be playing the piano and thinking: ‘Why is that benefiting my hip?’ There wasn’t anything where I thought: ‘I’m going to learn this.’ I was just so obsessed with my hip. My Instagram page, it’s meant to be quite a fun app, it was just hip exercises. I didn’t need to switch off. I went to Malta for three or four days and I was doing my hip stuff there. I didn’t want to switch off.

Sale estimate in the next two years if he continues to show the kind of disregard for his body that he used to, but the hope is that he will, as he says, work smarter not harder. “I will need surgery at some point,” Curry says. “I’m 26 now, until when I die, there will be another surgery. I don’t know when that’s going to be, we’ll just have to see.” He will have to be micromanaged through the season and, should he be offered an enhanced contract by Steve Borthwick, he will be the first real stress test of the professional game partnership. He would love to play a leading role for England this autumn, in particular, you suspect, against South Africa – he laughs and quickly moves on when asked if he would shake hands with Bongi Mbonambi – as well as on what would be a second British & Irish Lions tour in the summer.

Photograph: David Cole/Shutterstock Theatre It’s only LSD but I like it: the play telling the untold story about the Rolling Stones drugs bust Keith Richards and Mick Jagger’s 1967 raid and trial caused a national storm, seeming to pitch old against young, Establishment against counterculture. But was the real story overlooked? We return to the 60s at their most swinging Alexis Petridis Tue 17 Sep 2024 16.12 BST Last modified on Tue 17 Sep 2024 16.51 BST Share M ick Jagger and Keith Richards’ 1967 trial for drug possession at Chichester crown court is one of the most notorious incidents in the history of 60s rock. Everyone with even a passing interest in the Rolling Stones knows the salient details: the grim role of the News of the World in setting up a police raid on Richards’ country pile, Redlands; the entirely apocryphal rumours about Mars Bars and Marianne Faithfull ; the band’s brief attempt to escape the press attention by travelling to Morocco, where Richards began a long relationship with guitarist Brian Jones’s then-girlfriend Anita Pallenberg; the unexpected intervention of the Times’ editor William Rees-Mogg, protesting against the severity of the sentencing in an editorial headlined Who Breaks a Butterfly on a Wheel? ; their subsequent release, Mick Jagger’s appearance on a hastily convened edition of the TV show World in Action , debating the whole business with Rees-Mogg, former home secretary Frank Soskice, the Bishop of Woolwich and Fr Thomas Corbishley (“a leading British Jesuit”). But when playwright Charlotte Jones was reading up on the Redlands bust and trial, it was another, more overlooked aspect of events on which she alighted. Michael Havers was an intriguing choice of defence counsel for Jagger and Richards. He was not a barrister like John Mortimer , who seemed to delight in taking on the establishment on behalf of everyone from the editors of Oz magazine to the Sex Pistols to the publishers of Hubert Selby Jr’s Last Exit to Brooklyn. Havers was the establishment, a Garrick Club member who helped wrongly convict the Guildford Four, became a Conservative MP and ultimately lord chancellor under Margaret Thatcher. Marianne Faithfull is trodden on by the court case. She ended up a heroin addict and she traces it all back to Redlands Moreoever, at the time of the trial, he was dealing with a very different kind of youth rebellion from Jagger and Richards ’ LSD-soaked weekend in the country. Having already declined to attend Eton as per family tradition, his son Nigel had announced his intention not to follow his father, grandfather and older brother into a legal career but instead to become an actor. “When I realised Michael Havers’ son was Nigel Havers – everybody knows who he is! – I thought: there’s a father-son story, a domestic rebellion story that an audience can really get hold of, even if they’re alienated by the bigger political or global story of the Rolling Stones,” Jones says. “They were such a symbol of rebellion but I wanted to mirror it and see how the smaller, personal rebellion is influenced by what the Stones are doing.” View image in fullscreen No standard courtroom drama … Brenock O’Connor as Richards, Emer McDaid as Marianne Faithfull and Jasper Talbot as Jagger. Photograph: Craig Sugden To her delight, she discovered that not only had Nigel Havers been around the trial, he had become close to Faithfull, who – as Jones notes – was in some ways the biggest victim of the Redlands controversy, despite not actually being on trial nor even giving evidence. “I went to visit Marianne in Paris a few years ago, and she was really angry about Redlands. She felt it ruined her life. I really empathised with this woman who wasn’t allowed to speak at the time, but at the same time, the tabloids were writing about as Miss X.” She goes on: “You know, they were writing about her in the same way that they wrote about Caroline Flack recently. She was really, really delighted that someone would tell her side of the story. She told me Nigel was ‘like my little brother’. There’s such a touching, beautiful unknown celebrity story in the middle of this. She helped Nigel out on his journey, but she’s kind of trodden on by the court case and shut out – the 1970s were terrible for her” – Faithfull ended up an anorexic heroin addict, at one point living on the streets of Soho – “and she traces it all back to Redlands.” The judge managed to turn me into some folk hero overnight – and I’ve been playing up to it ever since Keith Richards We’re talking in a London studio during rehearsals for Redlands, which was commissioned by the Chichester Festival theatre : “a no-brainer” according to director Justin Audibert, given its setting. People can still remember bunking off school to try and catch a glimpse of the Stones at court, he says, and Richards – who still owns Redlands in the nearby village of West Wittering – remains something of a local hero. “There are loads of amazing stories about Keith doing nice things in the community: contributing money to the chapel roof repairs, joining the protests when they were going to close Chichester hospital. They love him, everyone’s got a story about him because he used to go to the pub a lot and so on. We made contact with his son Marlon, who’s been amazing. He lives in Chichester still, he’s got really local roots, he’s very beloved.” When the rehearsals recommence, it’s very clear that Redlands isn’t a standard courtroom drama, not least because proceedings are interrupted by Jagger and Richards – played by Jasper Talbot and Brenock O’Connor respectively – breaking into a rendition of Mercy, Mercy, the Don Covay song the Rolling Stones covered on their 1965 album Out of Our Heads. Jones says she always wanted the show to feature music – “I was writing in lockdown, I thought: ‘I want a massive cast, a massive stage, music, I want it to be funny, because we’ve got no theatre at the moment’” – but she doesn’t think of it as a musical, “even though there’s eight songs in it”, the use of which the Stones’ management has approved. View image in fullscreen No satisfaction … Jagger on his way to jail. Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty Images “We sent the play to their people, we didn’t know if we’d get the rights. It’s been a bit of a journey, but we got there,” says Audibert, who adds that the songs used are all “pre-1967 stuff”, intended to underline what had fuelled the Stones in the first place, behind all the lurid headlines. “It was really important to me that we paid homage to the fact that what these two kids were really interested in was R&B, that bluesy, rootsy feel. We’re trying to tell that story as well.” Judging by the rehearsal, they’ve managed to avoid what you might imagine was the biggest pitfall in depicting Jagger and Richards on stage. Both have ingrained public images that border on the cartoonish – indeed, Richards has claimed his piratical outlaw persona was born during the Redlands hearing, where “the judge managed to turn me into some folk hero overnight – I’ve been playing up to it ever since”. When someone’s spent decades building up a facade, how do you break through to reveal the person underneath? “What you’re trying to do is get the essence of a person, avoiding all direct mimicry,” Audibert says. “You have to ask yourself about a 24-year-old Mick Jagger: he’s a bit scared of the trial, but also maybe not taking it seriously to start with – how would that feel? If it was just a kind of Stella Street impersonation, the audience wouldn’t care and the audience have got to care about them.” The Redlands trial was an event that began to be mythologised almost the minute it finished, not least by the Stones themselves. Within weeks of its conclusion, they released the single We Love You , with an accompanying promotional clip that depicted Jagger and Faithfull as Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas, with Richards as the judge presiding over Wilde’s trial. It subsequently inspired everything from books to visual art – Richard Hamilton’s painting Swingeing London 67 featured Jagger handcuffed to fellow defendant, art dealer Robert Fraser, in the back of a police van – almost all of which have hailed it as a hard-won victory for the youth counterculture over the repressive forces of the establishment. But the truth is more complex. A contemporary poll, mentioned in the World in Action documentary, revealed that 85% of young people thought Jagger and Richards deserved to go to jail: evidence that, despite Richards’ celebrated line in court about young people not caring about “petty morals” , the counterculture hadn’t spread much beyond a clique of London hipsters. The real fissure wasn’t between old and young, but within the British establishment, between those broadly sympathetic, like Rees-Mogg, and those who felt it represented an assault on British values: if recent years have shown us anything, it’s that said fissure certainly didn’t result in a complete collapse, nor did it do much to curb the behaviour of tabloid newspapers. Jones says Nigel Havers thought the trial changed his father a little – “he thought Mick and Keith were really bright, it kind of softened him; certainly he relished his son’s career as an actor” – but it clearly didn’t turn him into a liberal, as his controversial tenure as attorney general proved. “I don’t think there’s a single message to the play,” nods Jones. “It’s complex and imperfect, as life is. I feel that we’re in a world that’s so polemical at the moment, it’s a play about being compassionate about the people who are around you. It’s about people accommodating each other; coming together rather than facing each other off. Even the Stones dressed up in nice suits for the appeal.” Redlands is at Chichester Festival theatre, 20 September-18 October Explore more on these topics Theatre The Rolling Stones Mick Jagger Keith Richards News of the World Crime Newspapers features Share Reuse this content Comments (…) Sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion Most viewed Most viewed Film Music TV & radio Books Art & design Stage Games Classical News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email About us Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Modern Slavery Act Tax strategy Digital newspaper archive Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn X Newsletters Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Patrons Back to top © 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Cinematic/Alamy Stream team Film A tale of two divas: Brittany Murphy and Dakota Fanning match wits in Uptown Girls Murphy’s screwball chops are perfectly pitched against Fanning’s precocious put-downs in this 2003 comedy that’s equal parts froth and feeling Luke Goodsell Tue 17 Sep 2024 16.00 BST Share T here’s no more joyous nine minutes on the internet than the clip of a 24-year-old Brittany Murphy , all cartoon eyes and razor-cut blond bob, giving MTV a tour of a midtown Manhattan Blockbuster store in the summer of 2002. She cartwheels and crashes into shelves. She waxes lyrical about Drew Barrymore, Shrek and Bob Fosse. She executes an absurdist runway walk with a pucker that would make Derek Zoolander blush. It’s a whirligig of giddy, deranged exuberance – the ideal show reel, in other words, for a screwball superstar in waiting. By the early aughts, Murphy – already something of a generational talent, thanks to scene-stealing performances in Clueless, Girl, Interrupted, and 8 Mile – seemed primed for leading role stardom. And what better way to achieve it than to team up with – sorry to Nicole Kidman and her fellow Oscar strivers – another of the era’s other great actors: the pint-sized old soul Dakota Fanning ? Go fish: Piranha 3D makes Saving Private Ryan look like an afternoon picnic Read more A fizzy comedy of duelling divas that wields a surprising emotional kick, 2003’s Uptown Girls stars Murphy as Molly Gunn, a New York City party princess whose frivolous existence unravels when she loses her late rock star daddy’s fortune, forcing her to take a job nannying Fanning’s Lorraine “Ray” Schleine: a fun-hating eight-year-old coping with her own absent parent issues. “I’m miss proletariat now,” Molly announces, with all the conviction of an heiress who has just been evicted from her Upper West Side penthouse. “Mop the floors, spank the brat, pick up the paycheque on Friday.” View image in fullscreen Apartment antics: a ‘perky fantasy’ of Manhattan is captured with beguiling spark. Photograph: Cinematic/Alamy Molly’s fall from grace proves the perfect showcase for Murphy’s manic energy and knack for physical comedy, her unswerving optimism matched only by her ability to collapse on a broken heel, slip on a tide of laundry suds or yank her adorable miniature pig across town. As the precocious pill-popper with the Anna Wintour haircut and withering put-downs, Fanning is the straight-talking counterpoint to Murphy’s loopy paroxysms, and a delight for anyone – like me – for whom watching children tyrannise adults remains one of cinema’s great pleasures. “It’s a harsh world,” Fanning deadpans in the movie’s funniest line, her guileless face lit like a noir villain as she tilts her shades. Murphy, who could go as dark as she was goofy, complicates Molly’s ditzy mien with a mounting sense of anxiety and loss. Her humanity cracks Ray’s hostile front, and Fanning – a preternaturally gifted child actor with a heavy emotional arc here – seems to relish the newfound sense of play. Beneath the film’s frothy exterior lies a tale of two lost souls. A sisterhood forged in the face of grief. Though dismissed as formulaic fluff by contemporary critics (though Roger Ebert got it ), Uptown Girls would eventually find favour with a younger audience connecting with its charismatic, tender performances – to say nothing of its fairytale vision of post-9/11 Manhattan, nor Murphy’s talismanic Blumarine dress ; there are entire articles devoted to the film’s fashion. The director, Boaz Yakin, whose urban drama Fresh surveyed the flipside of the city’s class divide, leans into this perky fantasy of his home town. It’s all captured with beguiling spark by the veteran cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, a man who knew his way around blondes in emotional distress. Long before his famous work with Martin Scorsese – with whom he eventually shot seven films, including Goodfellas and Gangs of New York – he was behind the camera on many of Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s tangled melodramas, including 1972’s landmark The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant. View image in fullscreen The knowledge of Murphy’s short life can’t help but haunt the film. Photograph: Cinematic/Alamy Ballhaus brings his expressive camerawork to Uptown Girls in a climactic sequence set on the Coney Island teacup ride, a moment of shared catharsis between Molly and Ray that hits hard for anyone lost in young adulthood – or forced to grow up before their time. Of course, the knowledge of Murphy’s short life – she died in December 2009, at age 32 – can’t help but haunt the film. Near the end of that 2002 MTV clip, the actor checks out her rentals and hops up on the store counter, in defiance of Blockbuster etiquette: “Because I can,” she giggles, “and I’ll never be able to do this again.” Moments later she’s gone forever, reprising her catwalk strut as she exits the store and dissolves into daylight.

Photograph: TIFF Film ‘I filed my copy from Waterloo station loos’: the Guardian’s theatre critics assess The Critic Ian McKellen plays a theatre reviewer in the 1930s in the new film adapted from Anthony Quinn’s novel Curtain Call – but how accurate is it? Warning: this article contains spoilers for The Critic Arifa Akbar , Michael Billington , Ryan Gilbey Tue 17 Sep 2024 14.00 BST Last modified on Tue 17 Sep 2024 14.02 BST Share ‘The friendship between a critic and an actor violates a boundary’ Arifa Akbar Oh, how I’d love to take bubble baths in the morning, long lunches at my club in the afternoon and arrive in the stalls by evening with my secret lover-cum-amanuensis and pencil-carrier in tow. Jimmy Erskine (Ian McKellen), chief drama critic of the Daily Chronicle, really does have it good. My quotidian reality as chief theatre critic of the Guardian cannot compare: a supermarket sandwich wolfed down before the bell, a frantic filing of copy after the curtain goes down (from a bench by the loos at Waterloo station on one occasion), or eating biscuits at my laptop into the small hours if it is a morning deadline. But then, Erskine is an acid-tongued anachronism, part of a dying “old guard” even in the 1930s of the film . His portrait still contains a kernel of historical truth, though: Erskine is part of a bygone era when a single, revered critic held godlike sway over public opinion. His real-life counterparts were many, from Kenneth Tynan to “Butcher of Broadway” Frank Rich, whose most scabrous notices could close a show. The Critic review – Ian McKellen’s poison pen sharpens 30s society cosy-crime drama Read more Those imperious emperor-critics are no more, their unilateral power diluted by the growth of the internet, with its mix of theatre vloggers, TikTokers, and other online critical voices who represent different ways of reviewing a show. And isn’t this a good thing? All of it makes criticism broader, less monolithic, although the power of some negative newspaper reviews can still dent ticket sales. Erskine is a cartoonish archetype of the evil critic, a Mephistophelean figure who is having his portrait drawn for “immortality” (the shadow of Oscar Wilde’s Dorian Gray looms large) and more than a little reminiscent of Addison DeWitt, the manipulative theatre critic in All About Eve. But how evil is he before Nina Land (Gemma Arterton), an actor desperate for his validation, pursues him for praise? We’d certainly consider him a dinosaur nowadays for his personal digs about Nina’s body and his bitching tone. That wouldn’t (and shouldn’t) be allowed. But in essence, there is bald honesty to his savagings of her wooden over-acting. She sees it as cruelty, he as rigour. The love-hate relationship between some actors/writers/directors and critics is well captured. Critics might be seen as charlatans or the devil incarnate until they write a glowing review, and then they become gimlet-eyed truth-tellers. As exaggerated as Erskine is, there is a ruthless honesty to his write-ups at the start of the film which is admirable, and essential for a critic. He has an absolute love of his craft, too. “Theatre is life itself,” he says, and I see his obsessive passion reflected in the best critics around me. His editor commands him to be kinder and this intrusion would rankle any critic today. It is true his verbal assassinations are hurtful. My rule is to express negative opinion in language I would use if the director or actor were in front of me. But Erskine’s style is built on waspish wit and elegantly formed put-downs, legitimate in their own right. The theatre industry may not like it, but some might argue it is its own art. Where the film is at its most instructive is in its warning against the transgressive relationship that forms between Erskine and Land. All About Eve warns against this, too, likening it to a devil’s pact. The Faustian bargain between Erskine and Land is more carnal but it amounts to the same thing: friendship between a critic and an actor is violating a boundary, and it leads Erskine to lose his integrity. If Land lived in the present, she might have sent Erskine an anguished email written at 3am (which critic hasn’t had one of those?) that he could simply have deleted. His fatal mistake is to engage with her out of pity, inviting her to his home, giving her advice on how to do better. Erskine isn’t the first critic to be hounded by an angry actor. I speak from experience. Where reviewers in other art-forms usually remain at a safe distance from those whose work they appraise, theatre reviewers are forced into close proximity every opening night. Any of us can lose our critical distance, maybe even our moral compass, if we cross the line, get too close, start to cheerlead rather than critique. It is, ironically, his initial kindness that leads Erskine to his doom. Graham Greene spoke of a splinter of ice at the heart of every writer. It is the same for the critic, in my view. Erskine shouldn’t have let his melt. A lesson to us all. View image in fullscreen Where’s my bubble bath? … Alfred Enoch and Ian McKellen in The Critic. Photograph: Sean Gleason ‘If you are mealy-mouthed, readers will spot it: if you are honest, you may lose a friend’ Michael Billington How lifelike is the current movie, The Critic? In most respects, it is miles away from the humdrum existence of today’s aisle-squatters. Set in 1934, it conjures up an era when the theatre critic was a journalistic star dictating his reviews – and in those days it was always a man – to an obliging amanuensis: it reminds me of a comment by Joseph Mankiewicz, who created the unforgettable Addison DeWitt in All About Eve, that “critics have acquired all the managerial trappings of performers”. If the movie’s Jimmy Erskine, memorably played by McKellen, is a celebrity, he is also a risk-taking gay man in an age of punitive sexual laws. But, if much has changed since the 1930s, there are moments when the movie expresses a fundamental truth about critics and others when it dwindles into melodrama. Patrick Marber’s Jimmy is loosely derived from a character in Anthony Quinn’s excellent novel, Curtain Call , who in turn was very closely based on James Agate, the Sunday Times theatre critic from 1923 to 1947. It is fair to say that McKellen doesn’t look much like Agate: a chunky figure in a loud-checked overcoat, whom Kenneth Tynan once told me resembled “a suspiciously clean farmer”. But between them Marber and McKellen accurately capture certain aspects of the critic’s life, from the compulsive note-taking to the use of fancy adjectives that irritate sub-editors. The one scene in the film that really resonated, however, was that where Jimmy faces the sack. Suddenly a man who has spent 43 years reviewing theatre is confronted by the prospect of empty evenings and unwanted opinions. Even a lucky beggar like myself, who retired voluntarily and who is still paid to pontificate, can understand what he feels. Theatre-reviewing, as a colleague once remarked, is a drug; and, although I never had to go cold turkey, I still find kindly people sometimes address me with the solicitude normally reserved for addicts in permanent rehab. But ultimately Marber’s script is about the corrupting effect of power and this is where I think it misunderstands the critic’s dilemma. The fictional Jimmy relishes wittily savaging people he doesn’t know. The problem critics face in the real world is the opposite: how to write honestly about people whom they do know. Even though I avoided showbiz after-parties, one can’t live like a monk and I sometimes found myself in the painful position of judging artists I had met socially. If you are mealy-mouthed, readers will spot it: if you are true to your reaction, you may lose a friend. I was never a close chum but for many years I had a genial relationship with Jonathan Miller until I heavily criticised one of his productions and after that he treated me as an enemy. Tom Stoppard, himself a critic in the early 1960s, once wrote, “I never had the moral character to pan a friend. I’ll rephrase that. I had the moral character never to pan a friend.” That, rather than the naked power-hunger displayed in The Critic, is the issue we reviewers face on a regular basis.

Photograph: Sean Gleason ‘Critics fraternising with the people they write about is a taboo, a red line, a no-no’ Ryan Gilbey Quentin Tarantino has always been open about his youthful love of film criticism. He studied the reviews of the New Yorker’s Pauline Kael “like class assignments” and even made a fictional film critic one of the heroes of his wartime thriller Inglourious Basterds . Now that Tarantino has abandoned his plans to direct The Movie Critic, about a reviewer on a 1970s porno rag, those of us who make our living judging the work of others will need to look elsewhere for solidarity. Not to The Critic, though. To the common assumption that we are parasites feeding on the failures and triumphs of others, this 1930s-set thriller adds a further insult: we are venal, self-serving ingrates who will stoop to blackmail and murder to cling on to our jobs. Perish the thought! Then again, a movie showing what critics really do in the cause of survival – sharing colleagues’ craven reviews and cockamamie predictions in WhatsApp groups, say, or flogging embarrassing stories about them to Private Eye – wouldn’t look half as dramatic on screen as hounding an enemy to suicide or drowning a blabbermouth in the bathtub. Younger reviewers will marvel at the treatment doled out here to the esteemed drama critic Jimmy Erskine, played by McKellen. On press night, he is tended to by theatre staff, who spirit his coat away and reserve him a quiet space in the bar to collect his thoughts. Even more astonishing is the moment when actor Nina Land (Gemma Arterton), confesses that it was his reviews that first inspired her to tread the boards. Maybe there are budding artists out there today who, like Tarantino or Nina Land, are driven by the critics they read. If so, their ardour will probably be all the more robust for having survived the cultural downgrading of the informed critical voice by aggregate websites and star-ratings, not to mention the skulduggery of studios that have fabricated quotes and/or reviewers to publicise their output. When Jimmy and Nina become friends and co-conspirators, it feels almost as shocking as the grisly turn the plot takes. After all, critics fraternising with the people they write about is a taboo, a red line, a no-no; it is impossible to do without the critical faculties becoming adulterated. Perhaps, then, The Critic is not at all the brickbat it first appears to be, but rather a cautionary tale to help steer modern practitioners away from sycophancy, hyperbole and partiality – a guide to What Not to Do. The downfall of Erskine shows what can happen when the critic drifts away from passionate engagement with an art form and toward serving their own ego or currying favour, either with readers or subjects. It’s a lesson that remains pertinent today. The next time critics insist on tagging the very people they’re praising on social media, listen out for a gentle splashing sound: it’s the tears of Gilbert Adair , Manny Farber and Dilys Powell raining down from heaven.

Election denialism has become a feature, not a bug, of a major political party for nearly four years. The fact that Trump, when given the opportunity by ABC moderators to distance himself from efforts to discredit the 2020 election during this month’s presidential debate, still refused to acknowledge Joe Biden’s legitimate victory is no longer surprising, though we are also inured to shock. ‘Do you have contempt for my views?’ How a leftwing film-maker and a Republican came together Read more But a new HBO documentary argues, through forensic chronological detail and, perhaps ironically, the testimony of Republican election officials and former members of Trump’s administration, for remembering just how beyond the pale attempts to subvert the 2020 election were. As recounted in Stopping the Steal, a new film from the Leaving Neverland director, Dan Reed, the period between election night 2020 and 6 January 2021 was a series of genuinely shocking, potentially devastating opportunities for democratic disaster that often came down to clashes between obscure, local Republican officials and the president of the United States. January 6, in fact, “isn’t the scary bit”, Reed said. “The really scary bit is all the machinations that happened before. Because had they succeeded, the knock-on effect would have been to just gum up the system. “Step by step, you can see that enough uncertainty was being injected into the system, and enough small gains were being made, to result in potentially a cataclysmic outcome.” Though Trump may deny any responsibility for January 6, his efforts to undermine the American electoral process and discredit the result in 2020 began the night of the election, before any network had even called it for Biden. At 2.30am, after news networks projected a Biden win in the crucial swing state of Arizona, Trump held an impromptu press conference in which he falsely claimed: “Frankly, we did win this election.” What happened next is a matter of real-time journalistic record, playing out over several weeks and relived in Stopping the Steal by the people who were there: administration pressure on election officials in Arizona and Georgia to support evidence-free claims of fraud or, in one infamous Trump phone call, to find him “11,780 votes”; activation of misinformation channels and true believers, who latched on to claims of fraud, harassed election officials and showed up outside county offices armed with AR-15s; a media campaign by Trump’s lawyers Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, Jenna Ellis and others bringing fringe legal “theories” into the mainstream; and finally the legitimization of crackpot legal theories to hijack the arcane electoral college, culminating in Trump’s January 6 rally. Stopping the Steal synthesizes these many episodes, through the perspectives of the officials – the then attorney general, Bill Barr; the Maricopa county supervisor, Clint Hickman; the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger; the Georgia election operations manager, Gabriel Sterling – who worked to prevent the steal by simply doing their jobs. The framing offers “a story told by people who love Trump, but who love democracy more, who love the institution more”, said Reed – mostly, Republicans who “held the line and who came under extraordinary pressure”. By their own admission in Stopping the Steal, these officials would have entertained evidence of voter fraud, even celebrated it, had there been any. “I had every motivation,” says Rusty Bowers, Arizona’s former speaker of the house, in the film. But there wasn’t – and Trump knew it. “He knows he lost,” says Stephanie Grisham, a Trump campaign and White House official for six years. “But he’s a narcissist and his ego will not accept defeat. And when you have people who will so willingly come around you and tell you you didn’t lose and the things you want to hear … that enables him to double down and triple down.” ‘A different level than 2020’: Trump’s plan to steal election is taking shape Read more So he tripled down, with the help of (seemingly) true believers, some of whom also appear in the film – Jacob Chansley, also known as the QAnon Shaman, and Marko Trickovic, who spread numerous conspiracy theories about votes being stolen or discounted. “The guys on the grassroots level, I think they really believe,” said Reed. “I don’t think they have any doubt that the election was stolen, because they inhabit a universe in which that is a given.” Reed, who also recently performed a similar forensic analysis on January 6 called Four Hours at the Capitol , maintains that including the perspective of the so-called “Stop the Steal” movement does not platform its beliefs; if anything, it puts the alternate universe of the “stolen” 2020 election in starker relief to the facts. “Whether you think they’re sincere or insincere, they’re protagonists in this drama,” he said. “It’s always good and fair to hear from them, and give them a chance to express what they have to say in a coherent way.

Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images “I presume my audience is intelligent,” he added. “I presume that they’re smart enough to know the difference between someone who’s indulging wish fulfillment or embracing a fantasy, and other people who are doing it for more cynical reasons.” Stopping the Steal ends with January 6, and makes no presumptions about what will happen in November if Trump wins or, perhaps just as distressingly, if he refuses to lose again, which some Republicans are already preparing for . “I’m not a political pundit,” said Reed. “I made the film because I want it to be a timeless film, because it marks a turning point in the way that we do elections. Now we have an option of: the Republicans won, the Democrats won, or someone stole it. We never had that option. That narrative didn’t exist before. ‘It got vile very quickly’: how Alex Jones turned a tragedy into a battleground Read more “The blueprint is there, the playbook is there – why would it be different this time, if Kamala Harris wins?” The day-by-day recounting of how the votes in 2020 were counted, and then protected – in nondescript county buildings, secretary of state offices, board meetings and eventually the US Congress – only underscores that a democracy is only as strong as its most obscure, smallest offices, whose character can make the difference between business as usual and a steal. “The functioning of democracy depends on people who buy into the idea that it should be fair,” said Reed. “If the system isn’t populated with people who embrace the basic idea of it, that it should be fair and everyone gets their fair shot, then the system no longer works.” Stopping the Steal, in revisiting the timeline largely through Republicans’ first-person narratives – it was not Democratic officials that Trump personally called – acts as a “non-partisan” review of the facts, “the look back that we can all share”, said Reed. The election in November will come down to how many people vote, where they vote, and for whom. But it will also be determined by “the remote gearboxes and the little bits of democracy you can’t see”, he said. “And that’s what we need to look out for. That’s what we need to shine a light on this time.” Stopping the Steal is now available on Max in the US with a UK date to be announced Explore more on these topics Documentary films US elections 2020 US Capitol attack US politics Donald Trump features Share Reuse this content Most viewed Most viewed Film Music TV & radio Books Art & design Stage Games Classical News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email About us Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Modern Slavery Act Tax strategy Digital newspaper archive Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn X Newsletters Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Patrons Back to top © 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Things started then’ … Alison Wilding in her studio. Photograph: Tomos Davies Art and design Interview Sculptor Alison Wilding: ‘Some of my works are very huggable. But I don’t want anyone else to touch them’ Chloë Ashby She’s one of the UK’s most revered sculptors. Yet Wilding is often overlooked. She talks about making art out of dead frogs, her feminist awakening and why ‘work comes from work’ Tue 17 Sep 2024 16.07 BST Share A lison Wilding is running late. Her cat brought a bird into the house this morning (“Dead or alive?” I ask, to which she responds, “Neither”) and she couldn’t face wringing its neck. She put it in a box and phoned a friend, and when they lifted the lid the bird flew away. As we settle into her studio – a mostly monochrome space in a railway arch in east London – I suggest it was a happy ending then, and she looks sceptical. The 76-year-old British sculptor has a career-spanning exhibition opening at Alison Jacques gallery in London this week. It’s called Testing the Objects of Affection and over the rumble of trains she tells me it’s about her relationship with the works on display, which she shaped between 1975 and the present. “It’s a test every time you show things, every time you open yourself up to the public gaze, whatever that is.” Is it daunting? “I don’t give a shit,” she replies, with just a hint of a grin. “I say that, but I will. I think it’s going to be OK actually – well, I hope so – but anything can happen.” Alison Wilding review – pure sculpture from an artist whose time has come Read more Wilding is known for her abstract sculptures, which, like her, are at once playful and solemn, generous and discreet. With a wide range of raw materials, techniques and forms, she creates subtle and surprising constructions that reveal themselves only when you walk around them, stand on your tiptoes or stoop down; she lends equal weight to bits that are found and made, costly and cheap. She made a name for herself in the 1980s with so-called new British sculpture , a catch-all term for the creations of a group of young artists (among them Richard Deacon and Anish Kapoor ) who were turning away from minimal and conceptual art towards a more traditional approach to making. She’s twice been shortlisted for the Turner prize, and she became a Royal Academician in 1999. In 2019 she was made an OBE. View image in fullscreen ‘It’s a test every time you show things’ … Hocus Pocus, 2022, by Alison Wilding. Photograph: Pawel Kasper Wysocki And yet, she’s been somewhat overlooked, which may have something to do with the slippery meaning of her work, and her reluctance to talk about it. When I ask about the earliest pieces in the show (photographs of a couple of installations): “I was doing some fairly abstruse things at the time, and those two pieces are quite odd … that’s all I’m going to say about them.” As to whether she thinks about the viewer while manipulating her materials: “No, never. I make work for me, and … deal with it.” Blunt she may be, but Wilding is also deeply thoughtful, and as the half-dead bird demonstrates, she has a soft side. “There are some works that I’ve loved hugging because they just seem very huggable,” she confesses, her face creasing into a smile that swiftly vanishes as she adds, “but I don’t want anyone else to touch them.” Did she always want to be an artist? “I don’t remember being interested in art, but I do remember being interested in objects,” she says of her childhood. Born in Blackburn, Lancashire, we grew up in St Ives, where she would take a table and turn it upside down to use as a boat, and climb inside a floor-length curtain and twist around until she’d formed a spiral. At school, she did a lot of drawing: “Introverted teenage-angst sort of stuff.” She went to art school because she wanted to be a beatnik. At Nottingham College of Art in 1966, she found herself surrounded by students who seemed to know everything. “I didn’t know anything, and I felt utterly at sea until I went into the plaster room. Things really started then.” She began exhibiting after graduating from the Royal College of Art in 1973, where she was the only woman in her year group, and one of three in the whole school. “It was a very misogynistic place, and actually in a way I just became one of the boys,” she says. “I wouldn’t say I was a feminist then because I don’t remember ever being angry about it. Although looking back I should have been.” Does she remember the point at which she started to … “Be a woman?” she interjects, deadpan. She was in a show called Eight Artists: Women at the Acme Gallery in 1978. “I’m not sure I would want to be in a show like that now, because like a lot of women artists I know, I think of myself as … an artist. What is it about a woman? I don’t know that my work screams this was made by a woman . It’s not something I think about.” Still, she’s indebted to her female friendships. After graduating from the Royal College, Wilding felt isolated. “Students now leave and hang around in a group. They show together, work together and support each other. I didn’t do that.” Instead, she took a studio in a block in Stepney Green (virtually opposite where she lives today), alongside older artists she didn’t know – “I’m sure they thought what I was doing was weird.” It was only when she moved to a new space in Wapping in the late 1970s that she felt part of a community. “Suddenly I was surrounded by a lot of women who were really supportive.” View image in fullscreen ‘I don’t know that my work screams this was made by a woman ’ … Terrestrial, by Alison Wilding. Photograph: Pawel Kasper Wysocki Last year, she had a show at Gagosian in Paris together with the late Phyllida Barlow , with whom she taught at Brighton Polytechnic in the 1980s, and Rachel Whiteread , who was a student there. “It’s interesting, with someone like Phyllida, because we were really close, but we worked in such different ways,” says Wilding. “She couldn’t stop making work, and she continued to make as much at the end as she ever had done; she had an absolute compulsion. I simply don’t have that. I’m amazed how much work I made in the 80s, one thing after another, and how little work I make now, how much harder it is.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Art Weekly Free weekly newsletter Your weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitions Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The most recent piece at Alison Jacques was born out of a couple of strips of rubber she’d rescued from an earlier work, semi-trashed. She discovered them at home and brought them into the studio because she was stuck. “I thought I could start a new work by reshaping the rubber and seeing what would happen.” Sometimes a material presents itself unexpectedly, as with the smallest work on display: a desiccated frog scaling one wall. She tells me she found it in her cellar a few years ago. “Probably one of the cats had brought it in and it had died through lack of whatever.” This sounds familiar. “It was fully grown, in an amazing frog-like pose, and totally covered with dust, which I meticulously swept off with a paintbrush. It’s set on a piece of copper in a long triangular shape, and it looks as though it’s dancing and being crucified at the same time. A sort of dance of death.” Too bad we won’t get to see what she could have done with its feathered friend.

Read our privacy policy Eight people have been killed and thousands of Hezbollah members wounded across Lebanon after their pagers suddenly exploded , officials said. The Lebanese health ministry suggested that eight people had been killed and around 2, 750 injured, 200 critically so, as a result of the explosions. In a statement, Hezbollah claimed that three people had been killed, including “a girl and two brothers”. The Independent could not immediately verify this claim, but the family of a Hezbollah member told Agence France-Presse that their 10-year-old daughter had been killed in Lebanon’s east. Another official from the group said the son of one of Hezbollah’s prominent legislators, Ali Ammar Mahdi, was killed when the device he was carrying exploded. A Hezbollah official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the detonation of the pagers, which took place at 3.30pm local time, was the “biggest security breach” the group had been subjected to in nearly a year of war with Israel . In one video, a man could be seen falling to the floor after a sudden blast while he was picking fruit in a busy market as people fled the area. The Iranian ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, was injured by one of the blasts, Iran’s Mehr news agency reported. In their statement, Hezbollah added that they are “conducting a wide-ranging security and scientific investigation to determine the causes that led to these simultaneous explosions”. Lebanese army soldiers stand guard in Beirut after explosions were reported across the country ( AFP/Getty ) The pagers that detonated were the latest model brought in by Hezbollah in recent months, three security sources said. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been exchanging fire with Hezbollah since last October in parallel with it’s war with Hamas, who control the Gaza Strip. The explosions come after Israel claimed it had killed top Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in an airstrike in the Lebanese capital of Beirut in July. Several other senior officials were killed on strikes on the Iranian embassy in the Syrian capital of Damascus. Hezbollah, which controls southern Lebanon, forms part of Iran’s so-called “axis of resistance”, which opposes Western and Israeli influence in the region. The group opened a second front against Israel a day after the war in the Gaza Strip began, triggered by a Hamas attack inside Israel on 7 October. A wounded man is carried onto an ambulance after his pager exploded in Lebanon ( AP ) Hamas, also backed by Tehran, killed around 1,200 people, with another 251 taken hostage. In response, Israel has bombarded Gaza from the air and ground. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the offensive, health officials in the strip have said. It has displaced nearly 90 per cent of the territory’s 2.3 million population. On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu‘s office said the safe return of its citizens to their homes near the border with Lebanon had been added to the government’s formal war aims. “The Security Cabinet has updated the objectives of the war to include the following: Returning the residents of the north securely to their homes. Israel will continue to act to implement this objective,” a statement said. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced from towns and villages on both sides of the border by near-daily exchanges between the Israeli military and Hezbollah.

However, Hezbollah, which also says it wants to avoid all-out conflict, says that only an end to the war in Gaza will stop the fighting. Gaza ceasefire efforts are deadlocked after months of faltering talks mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States. The “axis of resistance” comprises a group of violent proxies across Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon and Palestine, coordinated by Iran’s Quds Force, the foreign arm of the IRGC. The Quds Force’s aim is to export Iran’s 1979 Islamic revolution abroad. The US assassinated the former head of the Quds Force, Qassem Solemaini, in January 2020. Hezbollah, the most powerful group in the axis, boasts 100,000 fighters.

Read our privacy policy A hospital where staff allegedly physically abused patients is set to close as parents come forward describing the “brutal” treatment of their children, The Independent can reveal. Joyce Parker Hospital, a children’s mental health unit run by Cygnet Health Care, will shut following allegations by the national care watchdog, first highlighted by this publication, that staff were found dragging patients across the floor. Parents of the children who are in the unit, whose care is NHS-funded , have been told this week that Cygnet Health Care intends to shut and reopen the hospital for adults just weeks later. Multiple patients and parents have come forward with allegations of poor care since The Independent’s expose in August. “From day one, it’s been really brutal,” said the mother of a teenage girl still in the hospital. “She [my daughter] was covered in bruises. She was really distressed. I keep thinking this is my child, who is really unwell, and you trust people will look after her. She’s been pushed against walls, had her arms put around the back, she’s been put on the floor. My daughter is so much worse than she was when she got there.” Have you worked or been treated at this hospital and have a story? email rebecca.thomas@independent.co.uk The closure comes after The Independent revealed a leaked letter from the Care Quality Commission to the hospital warning inspectors had allegedly found CCTV footage from May 2024 of staff dragging children across the floor while restraining them. The watchdog told Cygnet Health Care it was concerned over the evidence suggesting physical abuse of the patients while staff were restraining them. Cygnet Healthcare said it “strongly refutes” the CQC’s claims of abuse. Another mother, whose son was at the hospital from August 2022 to February 2023, alleged that he was “dragged on the floor by his feet” out of his room by workers. She also alleged her son was not able to leave the ward and go into the garden for two months due to short staffing problems in the unit. “It was all very new to us, very new to him, and he just found it all so traumatic,” the mother said. “One time [in response to a self-harm attempt] he was dragged from the room by his feet. He was taken to another room, past other young people on the ward, and held down in the chair with quite heavy restraints into his shoulders. “I raised concerns about it. I complained to the directors, and they gave us someone to deal with that complaint, and they said there wasn't, there wasn't sufficient CCTV.” She added in another incident more traumatic than the restraining, her son made a serious attempt on his life while he was meant to have been checked on every 15 minutes. She said he is now having to have trauma therapy as a result. A former patient, Demi Grinsell, now 19, was in the hospital’s Pixie ward in August 2022. Ms Grinsell alleges staff would allow her to seriously self-harm in front of them. In one incident she described being restrained by multiple male nurses despite her health records maintaining that she should only be restrained by workers of the same sex due to previous trauma. “I can't even count how many times I did that [self-harmed] and obviously, that would then lead to restraints, not full body restraints, but them just trying to get it off me,” she said. “But there was in my notes that it was only females that were supposed to be allowed to do that. Still, males were allowed to restrain me and put their hands on me, which made me a lot worse.” Despite only being in the hospital for two months Ms Grinsell claimed she was left in a worse mental health state than when she was admitted. “After coming out of the hospital, I continued to harm myself but it was because of things that had happened there,” she added. “I couldn't get out of that cycle of repeatedly hurting myself.” Joyce Parker, previously a hospital for women with mental health conditions, was placed in special measures by the CQC in 2019 following the death of 25 year-old patient Claire Greaves the year before. An inquest found insufficient staffing levels likely contributed to her death. Following the 2019 CQC report, Cygnet reopened the hospital as a children’s service. The NHS hands tens of millions to Cygnet Health Care each year and it is one of the biggest providers to the health service of inpatient mental health care. A spokesperson for Cygnet Joyce Parker Hospital said: “After careful consideration, we have made the decision to change the services offered at the hospital and to discontinue our Child and Adolescent Mental Health provision at the site. “The hospital remains open as we make these changes and our immediate priority is to continue supporting the young people in our care. We will work with our partners, including commissioners, CQC, service users and their families, to ensure each patient has a smooth transfer to a new setting, best suited to their individual needs. “We remain committed to providing the highest standards of care at Cygnet Joyce Parker Hospital in the future and continue to strongly refute any allegations of abuse that have been made.” A spokesman for Toucan added: “Cygnet Healthcare has announced that it intends to close the CAMHs service at the Joyce Parker Hospital. “The NHS will be working with Cygnet to find suitable alternative placements for the nine young people who remain at the hospital."" The CQC was approached for comment.

Read our privacy policy A Labour minister has been grilled over Sir Keir Starmer ’s decision to accept tens of thousands of pounds in gifts and hospitality, amid a row over his late declaration of a donation by a Labour peer to pay for dresses for his wife Victoria. Sir Keir was facing questions over the £5,000 donation from ex-Asos chair Lord Waheed Alli which he initially failed to put on his register of interests. The PM has insisted his team had reached out for advice on what declaration should be made and that rules are being followed. While the commissioner has decided not to investigate, Home Office minister Dame Angela Eagle was repeatedly pressed by reporters on Tuesday about Sir Keir’s acceptance of gifts – totalling more than £65,000 in the nine months to May ahead of cutting the winter fuel allowance for millions of pensioners. Dame Angela told Times Radio she had no opinion on Sir Keir accepting gifts and accused the host of “ranting”. However she conceded to Sky News that she was not sure whether it was “possible to have an explanation” for accepting Coldplay tickets.

Referring to the race, which is due to continue at Conservative Party Conference, Sir Ed said: “Look at the quartet heading to Birmingham in a fortnight to audition for the job of Conservative leader. “They really are scraping the bottom of the barrel with these new TV reality shows, aren’t they? “I hear they’re planning to call it Strictly Come Pandering. “Or maybe The Great British Blame Off. “Or maybe just Pointless .” Andy Gregory 17 September 2024 16:52 1726586713 Labour minister defends Starmer over donor row: ‘He’s an Arsenal fan’ Labour minister Dame Angela Eagle defended the prime minister after he accepted more than £65,000 in gifts in the nine months to May, including football away games and concert tickets. The Home Office minister was quizzed about the donations by Sky News presenter Kay Burley on Tuesday’s breakfast show Burley said: “The freebies include the Royal Box at Wimbledon, hospitality at a Coldplay concert, Arsenal away games. How does that align with the son of a toolmaker, man of the people image?” Dame Angela replied: “I think he’s an Arsenal fan, it takes all things I suppose.” Labour minister defends Starmer over donor row: ‘He’s an Arsenal fan’ Labour minister Dame Angela Eagle has defended the Prime Minister following reports he accepted at least £76,000 of gifts, including football away games and concert tickets.

The ultimate vision is for Oxford Street to regain its shopping chops and, as a “traffic-free pedestrianised avenue”, become a “leading retail destination in the world”, one that can compete with the Champs-Elysees and Times Square. Pedestrianisation looks good on paper and is wildly popular with Londoners sick of their roads being clogged with traffic – but it will not be the panacea for cleaner air and “active travel” that Khan thinks. There will be unintended consequences, creating new conflict for those on foot. For pedestrians, Oxford Street will become a sniper’s alley. Sorry, Sadiq, but pedestrianising Oxford Street will have unintended consequences Sadiq Khan’s ban on traffic through central London will not be the panacea for shoppers on foot that he imagines, says Paul Clements Andy Gregory 17 September 2024 15:56 1726583833 Government urged to make ‘this year the last NHS winter crisis' Turning to the NHS, Sir Ed Davey told the Lib Dem annual conference: “We know the terrible state of the public finances thanks to the Conservatives’ shocking mismanagement. There can be no doubt about the scale of the challenge ahead. “Yet that makes it even more important to make the investment we’ve proposed in frontline NHS services – not less. Because if you invest wisely, if you make sure people can get the care they need, when and where they need it, if you bring down waiting lists and get people back to work, if you help people to stay healthy for longer, not only will you dramatically improve people’s lives, but you will actually save taxpayers’ money in the future and give the economy the boost it needs. “The problem is, the Treasury simply isn’t wired to think this way. Instead, we have the short-term negative thinking that leads governments to postpone hospital repairs and cancel new buildings - short-term thinking to save a bit of money now, even though you know it will only cost a lot more in the future.” The Lib Dem leader added: “What if, instead of stumbling from crisis to crisis, instead of throwing more and more money at just plugging the gaps, what if we invested now to make the NHS winterproof? “The government could and should make this year the last winter crisis in our NHS.” Andy Gregory 17 September 2024 15:37 1726582813 Ed Davey reveals rejected election stunt ideas Wing walking on a biplane was among the stunt ideas “rejected” during the Lib Dem election campaign, Sir Ed Davey has suggested. He told conference delegates that he is “not supposed to tell you what stunt ideas were rejected - not least because they’re still trying to persuade me to do them for the next election”. He added: “But I’ll let you into a little secret. It was only health and safety rules that stopped me putting my hand up a cow’s behind or wing walking on a biplane.” Andy Gregory 17 September 2024 15:20 1726582266 Ed Davey sings to Abba as he arrives for conference speech Sir Ed Davey sang along to Abba’s “Take A Chance” as he arrived on stage for his Brighton conference keynote speech. The leader of the Liberal Democrats said: “It’s been joyful, hasn’t it? Getting together to celebrate, and to start planning the future – having fun, but with a serious focus. “It reminds me of our election campaign. Do you know they wanted me to wear a wetsuit today? But I said it was abseiling or nothing, so here we are, having a party after winning our largest number of MPs for over 100 years.” ( Gareth Fuller/PA Wire ) Andy Gregory 17 September 2024 15:11 1726581786 Video report: Ed Davey to take aim at Tories in closing Lib Dem conference speech Ed Davey to take aim at Conservatives in closing Lib Dem conference speech Andy Gregory 17 September 2024 15:03 1726579708 Government ‘working to tackle small boats on all fronts' Responding to the news that 10,000 people have crossed the Channel in small boats since Labour came to power, a No 10 spokesperson told reporters: “Immediate work has been taking place. “That includes starting to process asylum cases again where people have been sat in hotels without their cases being looked at. “The prime minister spoke yesterday about 3,000 people being returned over the course of the summer and made the comparison with the £700m spent on four voluntary returns around the Rwanda scheme. “In addition to that we have also announced a 50 per cent uplift in NCA officers in Europol and funding for 100 additional NCA officers, and you’ve also heard the home secretary announce new surveillance technology and investment in the Border Security Command.” They added: “This is an issue that we are tackling on all fronts.” Andy Gregory 17 September 2024 14:28 1726578433 No 10 denies being a ‘nest of vipers' Downing Street has denied there was a “nest of vipers” behind the scenes in Sir Keir Starmer’s administration following reports of tensions involving senior officials. Following reports that cabinet secretary Simon Case – the country’s top civil servant – is under pressure to quit early because of anger over leaks and hostile briefings about the Downing Street operation, a No 10 spokesperson said he “remains focused on delivering” for the PM and is working closely with both Sir Keir and the cabinet. Mr Case, who has suffered from poor health, is widely expected to leave his role in the coming months. The Guardian reported that he has been privately accused of failing to clamp down on leaks about donations from Lord Alli and of reported rows between chief of staff Sue Gray and other officials. Put to her that Downing Street sounded like a “nest of vipers”, the spokesperson said: “I don’t recognise that. More generally, I wouldn’t usually get into those kinds of reports around staffing. “The cabinet secretary remains focused on delivering for the prime minister and the work of government and working closely with the prime minister and cabinet.” Andy Gregory 17 September 2024 14:07 1726577721 David Lammy says climate change is more urgent threat than terrorism or Putin David Lammy has warned that climate change is a more urgent threat than terrorism or Vladimir Putin in a major speech in which he pledged to put the emergency at the centre of British foreign policy. Tackling the crisis, which is “accelerating towards us”, will also boost growth in the UK, the foreign secretary said. “The threat may not feel as urgent as a terrorist or an imperialist autocrat. But it is more fundamental. It is systemic. Pervasive. And accelerating towards us,” he warned. Mr Lammy blasted Russia’s “fascism” and “imperialism” last week on a visit to war-torn Ukraine. He made the vow after the death toll in central Europe rose to at least 15 in the wake of a series of devastating floods.

Read our privacy policy Sir Ed Davey has set out plans to “winterproof the NHS ”, calling for a taskforce to be established to end the annual winter crises facing the health service. The Liberal Democrat leader used his conference speech to urge Sir Keir Starmer to “make this year the last winter crisis in our NHS”. After opening the speech by singing Take a Chance on Me by ABBA, Sir Ed pointed to the £376m which is spent on average each year tackling the winter crisis in the NHS, calling instead for the cash to be invested in shoring up the service. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey will deliver his conference speech later (Stefan Rousseau/PA) ( PA Wire ) His proposed taskforce would spend £1.5bn in the next four years to build resilience in hospital wards, A&E departments, ambulance services and patient discharging. Addressing activists and MPs gathered in Brighton, Sir Ed said: “Practically every year I can remember, governments have ended up announcing hundreds of millions of pounds of emergency funding to help the NHS through another winter crisis. To paper over the cracks. “What if – instead of stumbling from crisis to crisis, instead of throwing more and more money at just plugging the gaps – we invested now, to make the NHS winterproof? “The Government could and should make this year the last winter crisis in our NHS. “So I urge Labour: do not make the same mistakes the Conservative Party did. Be more positive. Act now. Show the ambition and urgency this moment demands – and save our NHS now.” The speech marks the end of a conference which has seen the Lib Dems set out plans to leapfrog the Tories as Britain’s second biggest party after the next general election. Months after the party surged to its best result on record, with 72 MPs elected, Sir Ed promised to “repay in full” the trust voters put in his party. He said: “People’s trust isn’t something you just win and put in the bank, to make a withdrawal at the next election. “Trust is something you have to keep winning, keep earning, day after day after day. Or else people will just take it somewhere else.” Opening the conference on Saturday, Sir Ed continued a string of stunts seen during the general election, arriving on a jet ski. He has also played volleyball, tennis and ridden on a rollercoaster. But he revealed that some stunts were off limits during the general election, telling the conference: “It was only health and safety rules that stopped me putting my hand up a cow’s behind or wing walking on a biplane.” Sir Ed’s speech was heavily focused on the NHS, but he took the time to attack the Tory leadership candidates vying to replace Rishi Sunak . He said: “Just look at the quartet heading to Birmingham in a fortnight to audition for the job of Conservative leader. “They really are scraping the bottom of the barrel with these new TV reality shows, aren’t they?” Sir Ed’s criticism of Labour was lighter, condemning the “pessimism and defeatism” of Sir Keir’s government so far and urging him to “be more positive now”. He also attacked Labour for not mentioning carers in its manifesto or in Sir Keir’s King’s Speech. And, given the strong anti-Brexit sentiment among Lib Dem MPs and activists, Sir Ed urged the government to “fix Britain’s broken relationship with Europe”. He repeated calls for Sir Keir to reconsider having ruled out rejoining the single market, and added to the growing pressure on the government to negotiate a free movement deal for young people with the EU. Journalists have been repeatedly briefed at the conference about the Lib Dems’ plans to overtake the Tories. They are just 49 seats away from becoming the official opposition to Sir Keir’s government, and of the 27 seats in which the Lib Dems came second in July, 21 have Tory MPs. “Let’s finish the job,” Sir Ed told MPs and activists. Throwing down the gauntlet to the Conservatives, he said: “What a great chance we have next May, at county council elections in places like Devon and Surrey. “Places with Conservative councils that have let people down for far too long. “And places where we did rather well in July – and where we could do even better next time.” More about Ed Davey Liberal Democrat keir starmer NHS Rishi Sunak Join our commenting forum Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies Comments 1 / 2 Ed Davey calls for taskforce to ‘winterproof the NHS’ Ed Davey calls for taskforce to ‘winterproof the NHS’ Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey will deliver his conference speech later (Stefan Rousseau/PA) PA Wire Ed Davey calls for taskforce to ‘winterproof the NHS’ Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey will deliver his conference speech later (Stefan Rousseau/PA) PA Wire ✕ Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Read our privacy policy A man who died three weeks after receiving the AstraZeneca Covid-19 jab was given the vaccine despite not being eligible, an independent investigation has found. A probe into failings linked to the death of Jack Last, a young man who died in April 2021 from a blood clot linked to the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab , revealed the 27-year-old was wrongly called up early for the vaccine by his GP - and so, did not receive a jab deemed safer for under 30s. The report found his death was “a consequence of a combination of system shortcomings, human error, and tragic unfortunate timing”. His family have accused the NHS of a “litany of errors” that cost a “fit and healthy” young man his life. They said: “Sharing the horrific ordeal that Jack was put through is something that must be done to highlight the litany of errors that have cost Jack his life…Jack died following days of agony, with immense internal damage throughout his body, bleeding and clots in his brain.” These failures, according to the report, also included a “lack of urgency” in getting him a CT head scan treatment for possible blood clots and a misdiagnosis of his scan once it had been done. The three-year long investigation into his death, carried out by consultancy Facere Melius, found Suffolk GP Federation was forced to expand the number of people receiving the AstraZenenca jab amid fears over vaccine wastage at the height of the pandemic. The report said Suffolk GP services were being “proactive” in extending their vaccine invitations and doing their best to vaccinate people against Covid. Jack Last hadn’t yet reached 30, but was invited to take the AstraZeneca jab because of inaccurate GP records for his family ( AFP via Getty Images ) Days before his vaccination, on 30 March, the GP services had received “a large delivery of the AstraZeneca vaccine that was due to expire within a few days”. Despite Mr Last not being eligible for a vaccine because he was not clinically vulnerable, nor was he living with clinically vulnerable people, he was invited to have a vaccine and given the AstraZeneca version. According to the investigation report, inaccurate GP records for his family and a lack of checks when he came into the vaccine centres meant Mr Last received the jab shortly before warnings over its use in under 30s. “If Jack had not been invited to have the AstraZeneca vaccine early, he would have been in a much later cohort (starting 8 June 2021), by which time people under 30 were to be offered Pfizer or Moderna vaccines,” the report said. At the time the government continued to publish guidance from the MHRA that the benefits of the Covid-19 jab “continued to outweigh any risks”. Blood clots had been reported in less than one in a million at the time. Six days after receiving his vaccination, Mr Last began to get ill and was experiencing “severe headaches, sometimes with vomiting and visual disturbances”. However, his CT head scan in which a blood clot was visible was not reported by the hospital radiologist, and he did not receive treatment until a day after his hospital admission. He died on 20 April 2021 after sustaining catastrophic brain damage. Following an inquest it was concluded that the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab had triggered an over-reactive immune response causing blood clots in multiple areas of his body. Covid-19 restrictions in hospital at the time also meant his family were limited in visiting their son in the days before his death. His family said: “We believe part of the reason Jack was not taken seriously at the hospital to begin with was because the “safe and effective” mantra had been repeated so much to the point of it being gospel, that anything that went against this seemed offensive. As though you were somehow wishing Covid-19 on others or you were being deliberately difficult. “The report details the many horrendous and ultimately catastrophic errors from the moment Jack arrived at West Suffolk Hospital. It appears that at every turn since he checked in something went wrong, and Jack just couldn’t catch a break.” Medical director of the Suffolk and North East Essex Integrated Care Board, Dr Andrew Kelso, said: “Our thoughts remain with the family of Jack and have been throughout this very tragic case. “On behalf of all system partners, we are truly sorry for what has happened and for the loss, heartbreak and distress they must be experiencing...This independent review allowed the system to look at the incident from beginning to end, without the restrictions of organisational boundaries and without prejudice.” Suffolk GP Federation was approached for comment.

Read our privacy policy Sean “ Diddy ” Combs, the music mogul who has faced allegations of sexual abuse, was charged with racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution, according to a federal indictment unsealed on Tuesday, Combs, who was arrested on Monday evening in connection to the charges, is accused of running a criminal enterprise that included his associates, employees and the influence of his business empire to coerce, control and abuse female victims. That includes “ sex trafficking , forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice,” according to the indictment handed up by a New York grand jury. For nearly a year, Combs, 54, has faced a series of civil lawsuits that accuse him of sexual abuse, rape and misconduct. Now federal prosecutors have brought criminal charges against him. Diddy was in a Manhattan federal courtroom on Tuesday for his first hearing on the charges. Marc Agnifilio, a lawyer for Combs, called his client “an innocent man with nothing to hide.” He said the musician has been cooperating with federal authorities and voluntarily relocated to New York last week in anticipation of the arrest. “We are disappointed with the decision to pursue what we believe is an unjust prosecution of Mr. Combs by the U.S. Attorney’s Office,” Agnifilo said in a statement. A grand jury in New York indicted Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs on sex trafficking and racketeering charges. Prosecutors accused Diddy of using his position in music to force women into sex. ( AFP via Getty Images ) Federal prosecutors allege that Combs and his associates “wielded the power and prestige” of Combs to intimidate and lure female victims into Combs’ orbit under the pretense of a romantic relationship. Combs then forced victims to engage in “highly orchestrated” sexual performances, often with male commercial sex workers, which were often recorded and later used for Combs’ pleasure – something he allegedly referred to as “Freak Offs,” according to prosecutors. The indictment alleges that Combs subjected victims to physical, emotional and verbal abuse to compel them to engage in “Freak Offs,” sometimes distributing substances, such as narcotics, to victims to ensure their participation. “Freak Offs occurred regularly, sometimes lasted multiple days, and often involved multiple commercial sex workers,” the indictment alleges. Prosecutors say Combs maintained control over these victims by promising them career opportunities, leveraging financial support, threatening to revoke financial support, using violence or other intimidation tactics. He monitored the victim’s medical records, controlled their housing, tracked their whereabouts and threatened to use embarrassing and incriminating recordings of “Freak Offs” to maintain their silence, according to prosecutors. Marc Agnifilo, a lawyer for Combs, spoke outside of Manhattan federal court on Tuesday before the music mogul was set to appear on the charges. ( Getty Images ) Prosecutors say Combs’ associates helped him facilitate “Freak Offs” by purchasing the necessary items, intimidating or threatening victims and covering up any suspicions of abuse. When federal agents raided Combs’ homes in Miami and Los Angeles, they reportedly seized various “Freak Off” supplies such as more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant as well as narcotics. Additionally, they found three AR-15s with defaced serial numbers as well as drum magazines. Combs is expected to plead “not guilty” to the charges in his arraignment on Tuesday. “He’s going to fight this with all of his energy and all of his might, and the full confidence of his lawyers. And I expect a long battle with a good result for Combs,” Agnifilio said. Combs, pictured in 2022, has faced multiple civil lawsuits alleging sexual abuse over the last year ( AFP via Getty Images ) The criminal charges are the latest in sexual abuse allegations against the music mogul known for his Bad Boy record label and launching the Sean John clothing line. In November of 2023, R&B singer Cassie, whose full name is Casandra Ventura, filed a lawsuit alleging that she was trafficked, raped and beaten by Combs on many occasions over 10 years. She said Combs brought her into his “ostentatious, fast-paced, and drug-fueled lifestyle” not long after she met him, and signed her to his label in 2005 when she was just 19 and he was 37. Ventura claimed that the pattern of abuse began as soon as their relationship started. An anonymous woman also filed a lawsuit, accusing Combs and singer-songwriter Aaron Hall of rape. April Lampros, a woman who met Diddy while she was a student – claimed he had sexually assaulted her multiple times between 1995 and the early 2000s. Dawn Richard, a former bandmate, accused the music mogul of physically and sexually abusing her and others while the two worked together, according to a lawsuit filed in New York federal court . Former model Crystal McKinney filed a lawsuit claiming the rapper sexually assaulted her at his recording studio in New York City in 2003.

Labour may try to laugh off news that the PM and his wife have accepted free tickets, glasses and dresses, writes John Rentoul – but it’s more than a bad look Tuesday 17 September 2024 16:55 BST Comments Article bookmarked Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Don't show me this message again ✕ Keir Starmer faces questions over his failure to register on time high-end clothing given to his wife Victoria by a prominent party donor ( PA ) Y ou have to feel for Angela Eagle , the latest minister pushed in front of the cameras to defend the prime minister. She tried to make light of Keir Starmer accepting thousands of pounds worth of Arsenal tickets, saying, “I think he is an Arsenal fan,” and, “It takes all sorts.” Kay Burley of Sky News was not amused. Not even a flicker of a smile when Eagle said, “I’m not sure whether [it] is possible to have an explanation” for Starmer accepting Coldplay tickets. When Eagle, the minister for immigration, couldn’t deflect the questions with a joke, she stonewalled: “You’ll have to ask him.” At least she didn’t try to defend the prime minister by making things up about how the president of the United States and the first lady have a clothing budget – and how the Starmers accepted the donations so they could “look their best” when representing the UK – as David Lammy, the foreign secretary, did on Sunday. The prime minister’s acceptance of donations to pay for suits, glasses and his wife’s clothes is indefensible. It would look bad at any time, but two things make it worse. One is that he is asking some pensioners on low incomes to give up their winter fuel payment because the public finances are in such a dire state. The other is that he held himself out as morally superior to Boris Johnson, who accepted donations to decorate the Downing Street flat in which Starmer now lives. Setting higher ethical standards than Johnson ought not to be difficult and yet Starmer seems to have fallen at this low first hurdle. A clip of Starmer wagging his finger at Johnson in the Commons for failing to declare a donation on time is inevitably circulating on social media; now that Starmer has failed to declare the donation of his wife’s dresses on time. Recommended On migration, Starmer and Meloni have found common ground Letters: Irvine Welsh is lost in his own fiction Giorgia Meloni’s Albania migrant deal won’t work here Yet the prime minister had the front to insist, when answering journalists’ questions in Italy, that in his case the late declaration was evidence of his respect for the rules, because it was the result of his team “reaching out proactively” for further advice about disclosure. Not only that, but Starmer pretended to aspire to higher standards than Rishi Sunak, who was accused by Labour of using helicopters and private jets when trains would do. But Sunak was the Simon Calder of Downing Street: the Man Who Pays His Way. He and his wife paid for all their clothes. Sunak may be richer than Starmer, but Starmer’s salary is £166,000 a year, with free accommodation and travel. He can afford to pay for his and his wife’s clothes. Despite his high moral tone in opposition, Starmer took a relaxed view of the need for openness right from the start. When he was elected leader of the Labour Party, he declared several thousands of pounds of donations for his campaign – including £100,000 from Waheed Alli – after the votes had been counted. At least one donation appeared to have been declared after the deadline for the register of MPs’ interests. What is odd is that Alli’s donations to pay for Starmer’s suits and glasses were declared and reported before and during the general election campaign, but didn’t prompt much interest. It wasn’t until the report that Alli was given a pass to 10 Downing Street after the election, which he may have used to organise a party in the garden to thank other Labour donors, that the balloon of outrage went up. Now, the delay in declaring his paying for Victoria Starmer’s dresses has sent it even higher. Inevitably, the opposition has torn into the hypocrisy. Andrew Rosindell, a Tory MP and shadow minister, this morning described Labour as a “government of self-service”. And it is hard for the minister for the media round to disagree. This is all Starmer’s own fault. It is no use his protesting, as he did in Italy, that “all MPs get gifts”. They do not all accept them. Nor should they, if they lead a government that is asking children in poverty to wait for a strategy to offset the two-child limit on benefits. Recommended Starmer needs to make hard choices over Brexit Letters: What happened to Robert Jenrick the moderniser? Sorry, Sadiq, but pedestrianising Oxford Street will have unintended consequences We should be clear, however, what is and what is not a problem. What does not matter is Conservative allegations of cronyism . Starmer is entitled to take advice from Alli, even though he is a party supporter and donor. An early mistake in appointing Ian Corfield, another donor, to a civil service post, has been put right – and Corfield is now advising the government unpaid. What does matter, though, is taking personal donations when asking people to make sacrifices for the common good. It is not too late for Starmer to pay it all back.

Read our privacy policy A Sex Education star has shared distressing footage of the moment he was pepper-sprayed and tackled to the ground by police – accusing officers of racial profiling. Reece Richards, who played Eugene in the hit Netflix show, was going home after performing in Hairspray the Musical in Milton Keynes when he was pinned down despite being an innocent bystander . The actor said he witnessed two men fleeing a car crash near his home in Fulham , west London, when he became the victim of an unlawful arrest . He said he tried to point pursuing officers in the direction of the culprits when one turned to him and demanded: “Get to the floor or I’ll pepper spray you.” Sharing distressing footage of the incident on Instagram, he wrote: “They pepper-sprayed me, kicked my legs out from under me, threw me to the ground, and handcuffed me.” He added: “In a flash, I was face-down on the pavement with multiple officers holding me down, forcing my head into the ground. “I was already injured from the show, but having four officers on top of me worsened my injuries to my back, ribs, and stomach. “I couldn’t see anything, but I could hear my mum nearby, screaming and crying, begging them to let me go.” The actor has made formal complaints to the Metropolitan Police and the Independent Office for Police Conduct over the incident in the early hours of 4 September as he hit out at racial profiling in the force. The Met Police confirmed it had received a complaint over the arrest which was being investigated by its Professional Standards department. No officers have been suspended or taken off duty over the incident. “That feeling of helplessness will never leave me. I’ve been stopped and searched before but never have I been arrested or treated like this,” Mr Richards said. “Witnesses have since told me that the culprits were also handcuffed but were not pepper-sprayed.” He added: “I do everything I can to avoid interactions with the police, yet this experience has made it painfully clear that racial profiling remains a significant issue. “Being surrounded by armed police for no reason is a terrifying and traumatic experience.” A Met Police spokesperson said: “We are aware of a video circulating on social media of a man being detained in the Fulham area. “Officers often find themselves in dynamic, challenging situations and have to make split-second judgements on which course of action to take. “Officers had been pursuing three men who had run out of a car that had crashed in Fulham Palace Road after it failed to stop for police. “It is clear the man shown in the footage was an innocent bystander and he was dearrested as soon as this was established by officers at the scene. “All officers know any use of force must be proportionate and reasonable and they understand their actions will be scrutinised. “A complaint has been received in relation to his arrest. “This is currently being assessed by officers from the Met’s Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS), along with other material including the officers’ body-worn video footage. “None of the officers involved are subject to restrictions at this time.” More about Metropolitan Police IOPC Fulham 1 / 1 Moment police pepper-spray Sex Education star and ‘throw’ him down Moment police pepper-spray Sex Education star and ‘throw’ him down Reece Richards posted footage on Instagram and revealed he had made a formal complaint to the Met Police reecejrichards/Instagram ✕ Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Read our privacy policy “Well, one lesson l’ve learned is that just because I say something to a group and they laugh doesn’t mean it’s going to be all that hilarious as a post on X”. If you’ve got better things to do with your time than muck around on social media (anyone?) then you might have missed that rare glimpse of self-awareness on the part of Elon Musk , posted on X, better known as Twitter. The tweet referred to an earlier one he’d posted, a quote tweet in response to a favourite of his, @DogeDesigner – “Why they want to kill Donald Trump ?” Musk made a topical joke in poor taste about assassination. He’s now deleted it. In case you missed it (ICYMI), it read: “And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala” – with a “thinking face” emoji attached. The graphic vaguely suggested, predictably enough, a Democrat (or “far left”) conspiracy to murder Donald Trump . Maybe it’s being run out of the pizza restaurant the Clintons supposedly used as a front for their international paedo ring. Who knows? Musk was certainly trying to be funny, but with a satirical edge that is quite beyond him. It made the wisecrack even less amusing and more of an indictment of the tweeter himself. So he took it down. It’s worth pointing out that there would have been no chance of the Twitter moderators taking any action about such a hateful tweet for the obvious reason that he owns the platform, fired most of them – and removed almost all of the old rules against hate and violence; all because he is a self-styled “free speech absolutist”. This means that his social media channel is so clogged up with racism, Holocaust denial and neo-fascism that it’s almost impossible to breathe on there. His conversion to Trump and Trumpism (despite Trump’s well-known and unscientific aversion to electric vehicles such as Musk’s Twitter) has made Musk a political player – and his site into a turbocharged vehicle for the extreme right. Musk himself spends an inordinate amount of time making a fool of himself on there, entertaining or appalling his 197.9 million followers – and many, many more when the algorithms get to work. On the other hand, he spent $44bn buying the money pit, so he might as well get his money’s worth out of it somehow. Elon Musk is the richest man on the planet, with some of the trappings of a sovereign state. Aside from a global social media platform attuned to his interests, in every sense, he funds his own space programme and owns his own satellite network. He clashes and comments on the affairs of nations and supranational bodies – the US presidential contest, Brazil, Australia, the UK government’s response to the recent race riots , the European Union. He is the second largest maker of electric cars (after BYD of China, who behave themselves) and has plans to help relocate humanity to Mars in case of environmental breakdown ( which his friend Trump will do more than anyone else to bring about ). I wonder sometimes what life on Mars with Musk as king of the planet would be like. Well, like Twitter, I suppose: uninhabitable. Musk, for all his brilliance in many areas of endeavour, is also a child. There’s something inexplicably naive about the things he says, does and allows others to do on his platform. It may just that he can’t see how unhinged people are, nor how damaging they can be to other people and groups of people. He seems not to mind about all the international Jewish conspiracies that occupy too much of the Twittersphere; nor the way that X refused to take down a post that falsely claimed the Reverend Richard Coles is a paedophile. Nor does he much object to the antivaxxers, the “chemtrail” people, the flat earthers, the sovereign citizens, the fruitcakes, the fascists and the fools. What is so infantile about Musk is that he is a man who refuses to take responsibility for what he says, what he does and what he permits to happen on the platform he controls – the viral spread of misinformation, disinformation and evil. As a so-called “free speech absolutist” he disregards national laws, such as the long-standing prohibition on inciting racial hatred in Britain; and he is so spoilt he cannot bear to be challenged, as when he tweeted this, aimed at Taylor Swift: “Fine Taylor … you win … I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life”. X’s algorithms spread fascistic myths and propaganda – and, in doing so, are in fact one of the biggest threats to free speech and human rights on this planet. Musk is entitled to his views, but not to try and foist them on the rest of us. He is even trying to force advertisers to do business with them, when they would rather not have their brands parked next to some grotesque Islamophobic imagery. Musk, like Trump , is just another obnoxious, rich bully – and, in my opinion, dangerous with it . The sooner he takes for Mars, the better.

Rupert has codenamed his plan to divide control of his media empire ‘Project Harmony’, but as his children Prudence, Lachlan and Elisabeth arrive in court this week shows it shows it is anything but harmonious... Tuesday 17 September 2024 13:24 Comments Article bookmarked Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Don't show me this message again ✕ Rupert Murdoch, center, and his wife Elena Zhukova Murdoch arrive at the Second Judicial District Court in Reno, ( AP ) W hen is $2bn not enough? When you’re James Murdoch and it’s given to you by your father, Rupert . James’s lack of gratitude has earned him the sobriquet “the troublesome beneficiary” among Rupert’s lawyers. Presumably, the 93-year-old mogul has a less understated, not so polite, phrase of his own for his younger son. Certainly, Logan Roy from Succession would have one, if his son Kendall were behaving in such a fashion. It’s impossible not to compare the latest machinations within the Murdoch dynasty with the hit TV series. As in Succession , the Murdochs’ feuding involves glamorous lifestyles and mind-boggling sums – with $2bn handed to each of Rupert’s six children in 2019 – and show-stopping scenes, such as his daughter Elisabeth reportedly hurling a string of expletives at the old man in December last year, when he told her and her sister Prudence of his plan to rewrite the terms of the family trust so that favoured son Lachlan would secure control of the media empire. That was followed last month by Rupert’s wedding to Elena Zhukova, his fifth wife, at his California vineyard. Absent were Elisabeth, Prudence and James. Lachlan attended, of course. Looking at the photographs of the happy couple, you’re left wondering what Murdoch was really thinking; behind those eyes, was he boiling with anger? Prudence Murdoch, eldest daughter of Rupert Murdoch, arrives at the court for the hearing on the contentious matter of succession of his TV and publishing empire ( REUTERS ) The official root cause is a divergence of political views. Lachlan is right-wing – the same as, if not more so than, his father. The three other children from his first two marriages – he has two younger daughters with Wendi Deng, who are not party to the turmoil – are more liberally inclined. Apparently, they cannot be trusted to maintain the identity of the Murdoch brand. Recommended Watch: Murdoch arrives in court to determine fate of Fox News and Wall Street Journal Titan sub disaster hearing: Final text before submersible imploded revealed Trump recounts assassination attempt and hits out at ‘Marxist communist’ Harris: Live In Rupert’s eyes, they risk destroying the commercial value of Fox News, The Wall Street Journal , the New York Post , The Times , The Sunday Times and The Sun , along with his other newspaper and TV outlets. So, after initially promising that they would each have an equal share and an equal say, he is going to court in September to argue that, by changing the trust so that Lachlan is in charge, he is acting in good faith and for their sole benefit. He’s called the move – which is said to be aimed at restoring love and peace within the family before he dies – “Project Harmony”. Though you cannot help but wonder whether the cynic in him isn’t also sniggering. Harmonious it most definitely is not. Rupert’s lawyers, led by Adam Streisand (who fought cases involving the Michael Jackson and Britney Spears estates), claim that Project Harmony is motivated by the best of intentions, that it’s an attempt to bring order and calm – and that if four of Rupert’s children were to have an equal say, they would be forever squabbling over the leadership as the leftie trio tried to water down the group’s politics, disrupting the business operation. It’s hard to imagine that, even if Rupert wins and Lachlan is confirmed as being in charge, it will be the end of the feuding. Years of appeals and counterclaims must surely be on the cards. By seeking a trial now, Rupert may only have succeeded in triggering batteries of lawsuits and recrimination. In truth, however, all he’s done is to bring into the open something that was always going to explode. What’s intriguing is that Rupert has stressed his desire to continue leaning rightwards after the British general election resulted in a Labour landslide and his UK newspapers came out for Labour (albeit with caveats) – and when the US presidential race appears to have tightened, with the withdrawal of Joe Biden and his subsequent anointment of Kamala Harris as the Democratic candidate. Undeterred, Rupert wishes his newspaper titles to stay on the right. Lachlan Murdoch, center, and his wife Sarah arrive at the Second Judicial District Court in Reno ( AP ) That is where their brand identity lies, so he is correct on that one – Fox News will have an audience on the right just as it does now, even if there is a Democratic victory. But what is really occurring here is that he has come to the simple conclusion that four bosses would never work – not least because they do not get on – and that there should only, therefore, be one. What’s surprising is that he ever thought the four could be trusted to cooperate and steer the ship. Rupert’s own career has been defined by his single-minded approach; he does not enjoy partnerships. He’s convinced himself that Lachlan has the talent required to succeed him – although, given the fact that Lachlan seems to be forever present at his side, Lachlan may have convinced Rupert that he has the ability. Recommended Major companies abandon an LGBTQ+ rights report card after facing anti-diversity backlash Blow for Trump as judge rules RFK Jr’s name must stay on ballot in swing state Trump’s former chief of staff Meadows fails to get election interference case moved Certainly at one stage, Rupert was not prepared to entrust the business to him. But Lachlan’s rise, while the focus of his siblings has been elsewhere – with Elisabeth running her independent TV production company; James having gone down the eco-project route and, in the process, dissed the Murdoch media, especially Fox, for its denial of the severity of climate change (to the fury of his father); and Prudence remaining untried, untested in the commercial arena – appears to have hardened his thinking. The uncomfortable reality for Rupert is that none of them, including Lachlan, will ever be as good as him. Towards the end of Succession , Logan Roy delivers a heartfelt speech to his children. He tells them how much he loves them, but then says: “You are not serious people.” It’s the last line he ever speaks to them.

Read our privacy policy The attorney general is coming under pressure to ask for a legal review of the suspended sentence handed to former BBC presenter Huw Edwards . Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice has told The Independent that he is writing to Lord Hermer asking him to appeal the six-month suspended sentence for the disgraced BBC personality who previously admitted three charges of “making” indecent photographs. The court heard that the 63-year-old paid up to £1,500 to Alex Williams , 25, who sent Edwards 41 illegal images, seven of which were of category A, the very worst kind. Of those images shared over WhatsApp, the estimated age of most of the children was between 13 and 15, while one was aged as young as between seven and nine. Court artist drawing by Elizabeth Cook of former BBC broadcaster Huw Edwards stands in the dock at Westminster Magistrates’ Court, London (Elizabeth Cook/PA) ( PA Wire ) The sentence has provoked widespread anger but can only be made stronger if it is shown to be “unduly lenient”. It has been pointed out that the climate change Just Stop Oil activists who blocked the M25 got sentences of four and five years in prison. Even before Edwards was sentenced, Green Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay had questioned why protesters were getting longer sentences than sexual offenders. Others have argued that some who were arrested for the summer riots were given a disproportionate sentence compared to Edwards. A number of posts across social media noted that people received prison sentences for posting derogatory memes or “shouting at a police dog” while Edwards avoided prison despite having more than 40 indecent images of children. Mr Tice told The Independent : “The attorney general must take the appropriate legal steps immediately to review this weak pathetic sentence for Huw Edwards, which reinforces to millions of Brits that we are subject to two-tier justice. “There is little more serious than child sex crimes which devastate the victims” Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice has written to the attorney general(Maja Smiejkowska/PA) ( PA Wire ) The attorney general has the power to appeal sentences they believe are “unduly lenient”. The decision on whether to extend them then is a decision of the Court of Appeal. However, if a sentence conforms with sentencing guidelines then it is difficult to have it increased. As attorney general in 2022, Suella Braverman made a successful appeal for a stronger sentence for Frankie Smith who allowed her 16-moth old daughter Star Hobson to be killed by her partner Savannah Brockhill. However, her appeal against the sentences for the killers of PC Andrew Harper was unsuccessful. Passing sentence, the chief magistrate, District Judge Paul Goldspring, told the previously beloved household name that his “long-earned reputation is in tatters” after committing the “extremely serious” offences, stressing that the financial and reputational damage he suffered was “the natural consequence of your behaviour which you brought upon yourself”. Edwards presented mental health issues, strains in his marriage and his relationship with his own father as mitigating factors. Among the 377 sexual images discovered by police – sent to Edwards by Williams between December 2020 and August 2021 – were the seven category A images, which are of the most serious type, 12 category B images, and 22 category C images. But the judge did say he believed the former broadcaster’s remorse was genuine and that his mental health at the time of the offences could have impaired his decision-making. The chief magistrate said: “I am of the clear view that you do not present a risk or danger to the public at large, specifically to children. There is a realistic prospect of rehabilitation.” BBC director general Tim Davie has suggested that he can see no way back to the BBC for the veteran broadcaster, who was the voice for state occasions such as the Queen’s funeral. Speaking at the Royal Television Society (RTS) London conference, Davie said Edwards' offences were ""appalling crimes"" and that ""there's no doubt that an affair like this impacts our reputation"". Presenter Amol Rajan asked Davie why Edwards' pay continued after the BBC was made aware of the 62-year-old’s arrest. He replied that ""we decided that pay continues until someone is charged"" and added: ""I think it was the right decision based on current policy."" Rajan asked Davie how the BBC was getting back Edwards' £200,000 salary. He replied: ""We want the money back and we've asked for it back, and we're waiting to hear back."" Davie said that victims' families are the ""primary concern"" and said that young people who raised concerns over Edwards were ""taken seriously"" at the time allegations were made. He said: ""We're just shocked and there's a lot of upset because across the BBC. We've got great teams, good people and they feel deeply, deeply let down."" The attorney general has been approached for comment.

They will be on by default and can only be turned off with a parent’s permission. Parents will also be able to see more detail on their children’s accounts, such as who they are messaging. The changes come amid widespread claims that Instagram and parent company Meta are not doing enough to protect children from harmful content online. They are Meta’s most substantial changes to how young people use its apps ever. And it comes ahead of the UK’s new Online Safety Act fully coming into force next year. That legislation will require social media companies to protect children from harmful content online. The US has introduced similar legislation in the form of the Kids Online Safety Act, and experts including the US surgeon general have said that heavy use of social media could pose a health risk. Platforms, including Instagram, have previously been accused of failing to keep younger users away from harmful material on their sites, with many campaigners calling for stronger regulation to force companies to respond. Earlier this year, during a Congressional hearing, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg publicly apologised to parents whose children had been targeted by social media abuse . Former deputy prime minister Sir Nick Clegg , now Meta’s president of global affairs, said the aim of the change was to “shift the balance in favour of parents” when it came to using parental controls, while also hoping it would “act as a catalyst for a wider debate” around enhanced online safety tools. Teen Accounts will also have their interactions limited so that only people they follow can tag or mention them, as well as be sent a notification telling them to leave the app after an hour’s use each day, and will have sleep mode on by default, which will mute notifications and auto-reply to direct messages between 10pm and 7am each day. Alongside the protections, parents will also have the option to see who their teenagers have been messaging in the past seven days – though not the messages themselves, set daily time limits for Instagram app usage, block app use for specific time periods and see the topics their child has been looking at. Speaking to the PA news agency, Sir Nick said: “This is a very significant moment … the common refrain we keep hearing from parents is that ‘we want to exercise our responsibilities and obligations as parents’, but across the multiple apps that young people now use, parents were being left somewhat confused and disempowered from playing their role as parents. “This (change) really tries to very meaningfully shift the balance in favour of parents by basically putting teens into the strictest default settings over what content they see, who they can be connected with, what time they can spend … and crucially, if you’re under 16, they’ll have to ask mum and dad if they can change those settings. “And yes, from our point of view it might mean that some teens may use our apps less, but we feel, given everything we have learned and heard over the last, crucial years – and quite rightly, we’ve been put under an immense amount of scrutiny on these issues – we felt it was time now to shift the playing field in favour of simple, transparent, easy-to-use controls for parents, that’s the motivation behind this.” New teenage users who sign up to Instagram from today will be placed into a Teen Account, Meta said, with existing users set to begin being moved onto the new system next week, with plans to have teenagers in the UK, US, Canada and Australia on the new accounts within two months, and those in the EU later this year. Sir Nick added that a “wider ecosystem-level debate” was needed around age verification tools which worked across app ecosystems, rather than having to be implemented by each individual platform. “We hope this will act as a catalyst for this wider debate because there isn’t a world in which app-by-app solutions are sufficient,” he told the PA news agency. “That’s why we’re such an advocate of using the simplest, one-and-done moment to verify age and to give parents meaningful control, which is at the moment an app is downloaded from an app store – so to introduce app store-level age verification, which is not a huge lift because (Apple’s) iOS and (Google’s) Android collect all that data already.” The former Liberal Democrat MP argued that this type of tool was the “only workable way” to introduce “meaningful change” for teenagers. “Some people will say ‘Meta is trying to shuffle off its responsibilities’ – nothing to do with that at all. We wouldn’t be making these announcements today if we where somehow trying to shuffle off our responsibility. We take our responsibility very seriously,” he said. Sir Nick also said the potential loss of teenage users to rival platforms was “not reason enough” to not make the safety changes, and that the social media giant would rather be “at the front end of changes” within the industry. “I don’t think we should hide from the fact that there has been a very lively debate about this for a long, long time within the company,” he said. “Of course, there is a risk that teens will gravitate to other apps which don’t have these controls or use Instagram less than they do now, but we came to the view that this was not reason enough to not give parents the simplicity, transparency and controls they’ve been clamouring for. “Secondly, we’d much rather be at the front end of the changes which clearly need to happen in the industry, rather than be dragged along in the wake of changes introduced by others. “This is a big societal debate and it’s one which inspires, quite understandably, very, very strong emotions, because you’re dealing with the thing that people care about more than anything else in the world – their own children. “Regulators need to play a role, companies need to play a role, and parents and families need to play a role.” Additional reporting by agencies More about PA Ready Nick Clegg Instagram Liberal Democrat Australia Canada 1 / 1 Instagram launches huge changes to young people’s accounts Instagram launches huge changes to young people’s accounts The announcement comes as social media platforms continue to face regulatory pressure to better protect users, particularly children (Nick Ansell/PA) PA Archive ✕ Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Europe’s longest shopping parade, it attracts half a million people every day, even though it has seen better days – namely, the Georgian era, when it was known as the Ladies’ Mile, somewhere well-to-do women living in splendour on nearby streets could safely boutique-hop; or, better still, Tudor times, when all this was fields. Today, the stretch from Marble Arch to Tottenham Court Road is unlovely, hollowed out by internet shopping and laid low by the American candy shop contagion . Two years ago, the number of vacant properties on the street hit a new high – around one in every eight – and smash-and-grab gangs moved in. Aside from my own occasional dash-and-grab when a teenage niece has her heart set on a new puffa from Pull & Bear or a nephew with NikeTown gift vouchers to burn, I, nor any Londoner I know, ever shops on Oxford Street. Which all points to why Sadiq Khan has reannounced that he will pedestrianise “the nation’s high street”. I hope he has as much luck as he’ll have making that stick as a slogan. Under the mayor of London’s plans, which were first outlined in 2016 and are now to be pushed through in spite of objections from Westminster’s Labour-run council, motorised vehicles are to be re-routed onto surrounding streets, never mind the gridlock (thoughts and prayers, Fitzrovia and Marylebone). Recommended The tweet that has finally taught Elon Musk a lesson Inside the latest Murdoch money battle tearing the family apart As Starmer eyes Italy’s Albania deal, tell us if the UK should outsource migration The ultimate vision is for Oxford Street to regain its shopping chops and, as a “traffic-free pedestrianised avenue”, become a “leading retail destination in the world”, one that can compete with the Champs-Élysées and Times Square. open image in gallery How Oxford Street might look under the mayor’s plan to make it traffic-free ( GLA ) Which is, of course, a smashing idea. Who wouldn’t want to spend an afternoon taking a constitutional from the souvenir shops clustered near the big McDonald’s at Tottenham Court Road Tube, past the empty husks of long-extinct department stores and the vape and oud shops with their noxious clouds that catch the passer-by by the throat, all the way to the Marble Arch gyratory? Pedestrianisation looks good on paper and is wildly popular with Londoners sick of their roads being clogged with traffic – but it will not be the panacea for cleaner air and “active travel” that Khan thinks. There will be unintended consequences, creating new conflict for those on foot. Khan’s plan is guaranteed to infuriate black cabbies, which may be in the back of the mayor’s mind (and never a bad thing in my book): taxis, along with buses, currently have the run of Oxford Street. But the traffic-free masterplan means the elderly shopper or busy mum will no longer be able to hop on a double-decker outside John Lewis or hail a cab outside Selfridges. Oddly, there is no clear reference in the mayor’s blueprints to what happens to those on bikes. And if anyone is going to muck up Khan’s Arcadian vision, it’s cyclists . Thanks to it being such a straight, east-west route, Oxford Street already clocks up 4,500 bike journeys a day, and without so much as a cycle lane by way of special infrastructure. My suspicion is that cyclists will nominally be banned from the street, re-routed with other traffic onto nearby roads or required to dismount. But who exactly is going to make them? open image in gallery Under Sadiq Khan’s traffic-free masterplan for Oxford Street, shoppers will no longer be able to hop on a double-decker bus outside John Lewis or hail a cab outside Selfridges ( GLA ) When it comes to policing cyclist behaviour, pedestrians know to their cost how well that works. Many will bear if not scars, then bruises – like the one on my forearm, from the guy whose handlebars clipped me as he sailed past me on the pavement. Literally nobody stops bikes from being ridden on our paths. When it gets out that there’s a mile-long stretch of smooth, lawless, car-free road in central London, I predict it will become the speedway of choice for oiks pulling wheelies and practising bunny hops, or freewheeling through the crowds for fun. If you want to see in miniature what might happen, join the shoppers trying to cross the pedestrian bridge from Stratford station to the nearby Westfield. No cycling, skating or skateboarding, say the signs, put up when to attempt it on foot had become downright treacherous… but still, nobody stops them. The idea that cyclists could be left to simply weave through shoppers makes me a little queasy. A fortnight ago, a phone-snatcher was filmed stealing a woman’s mobile in broad daylight on Oxford Street before calmly making off on his e-bike. And what of lawless delivery riders in a hurry? Or those vulgar and dangerous rickshaws (how’s that crackdown going, mayor?) Recommended On migration, Starmer and Meloni have found common ground Letters: Irvine Welsh is lost in his own fiction House prices are on the rise – so why isn’t everyone happy? Khan’s measure may help London steal a march on rival big cities. Having experimented with car-free Sundays, Anne Hidalgo, the French capital’s mayor – the one who gamely went for a dip in the Seine before this summer’s Olympics to prove the water was sufficiently e.coli-free to host swimming events – has pushed through her plan to pedestrianise the Champs-Élysées’s eight lanes. But that won’t happen before the end of the decade. However, her “re-enchantment” (sounds even better in French) might have more impact than London’s because 90 per cent of Parisians last year voted to ban rental e-scooters which had made the place hellish. For me, a pedestrianised Oxford Street will remain a place to either avoid or endure. And at least there’ll now be lots more space in the West End to badly park a Lime bike with the usual disregard for pedestrians.

The 14-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, faces seven charges – three of attempted murder, three of wounding with intent and one of possession of a bladed article on a school premises in Ammanford, Carmarthenshire . The girl, who wore a white shirt and black tie, appeared via video link at Swansea Crown Court on Tuesday for a review of the case before it heads totrial on September 30.

The trial is listed for two weeks. Caroline Rees KC appeared on behalf of the defence. The girl previously denied three counts of attempted murder but pleaded guilty to the lesser charges of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm at a hearing last month. Pupils at Amman Valley School, also known as Ysgol Dyffryn Aman, went into lockdown on April 24 after the incident at the end of morning break.

Read our privacy policy Kyle Clifford has appeared in court charged with the murders of the wife and two daughters of BBC racing commentator John Hunt who were killed in a crossbow attack. Clifford, 26, was remanded in custody at Westminster Magistrates’ Court and then at the Royal Courts of Justice on Tuesday following the incident in Bushey, Hertfordshire, on 9 July. He was charged with three counts of murder, false imprisonment and two counts of possession of offensive weapons – namely a crossbow and a 10-inch butcher’s knife. Carol Hunt, 61, and two of her and Mr Hunt’s daughters, Hannah, 28, and Louise, 25, were found fatally injured at the family home on Ashlyn Close. The court heard Louise had been found tied up when officers attended the property, with the false imprisonment charge alleging Clifford “assaulted and unlawfully and injuriously imprisoned Louise Hunt and detained her against her will”. Kyle Clifford, 26, has been remanded in custody and is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday ( PA Wire ) She and Hannah had been shot with a crossbow and their mother Carol had been stabbed with a knife and suffered multiple injuries, the court was told. The court heard Hannah called the police and told them she feared she was going to die as she had been shot along with her sister and mother. The chief magistrate, district judge Paul Goldspring, told the defendant on Tuesday morning that the charges of murder and false imprisonment are “matters which can only be heard at the crown court” and that the charges of weapon possession are “related”. The defendant later appeared in front of High Court judge Mr Justice Johnson via videolink where no trial date was set because of inquiries being made about a suitable court for him to be tried in as a wheelchair user. Police were previously unable to speak to the suspect while he received treatment for an injury in hospital. Pictures left on floral tributes at Ashlyn Close, Bushey, where the family were killed ( PA Wire ) Clifford, of Rendlesham Road in Enfield, north London, has been under arrest since 10 July. Detective chief inspector Nick Gardner, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: “Our thoughts remain with the Hunt family and their loved ones as they continue to come to terms with their loss.” Lisa Ramsarran, chief crown prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in Thames and Chiltern, said: “Our thoughts remain with the Hunt family and all those who have been affected by this tragic incident.” Following the loss of three of their family members, Mr Hunt and his third daughter Amy said their devastation “cannot be put into words”. In the statement released in July, the pair also described the aftermath of the attack as “an extremely difficult time for us”. A view of police at the scene in Bushey in July ( PA ) Friends, family and colleagues paid tribute to the Hunts, praising them as “the most gentle, beautiful family”. Hannah’s boyfriend, Alex Klein, remembered “the love of my life” in a post on social media and shared a picture of the couple together. He said: “RIP the love of my life, I will never forget you, stolen from me too soon. The brightest light in my life. My brave queen for life. Until we meet again... I love you Hansy.” BBC and ITV presenters were among those paying tribute to the family, with Radio 5 Live host Mark Chapman sending his love to Mr Hunt and his family ahead of the coverage of England’s Euro 2024 semi-final in the summer. A clearly emotional Mr Chapman said: “John Hunt is our colleague and our friend, not just to the current 5 Live sports team, but to all of those who’ve worked here with him over the past 20 years, and also to all of you who have enjoyed his superb commentaries. So, on behalf of everybody connected to 5 Live Sports, our love and thoughts and support are with John and his family.” More about Crown Prosecution Service Hertfordshire BBC Hertfordshire Police Westminster Magistrates Court 1 / 4 Man in court charged with murders of family of BBC’s John Hunt Man in court charged with murders of family of BBC’s John Hunt Kyle Clifford, 26, has been remanded in custody and is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday PA Wire Man in court charged with murders of family of BBC’s John Hunt Pictures left on floral tributes at Ashlyn Close, Bushey, where the family were killed PA Wire Man in court charged with murders of family of BBC’s John Hunt A view of police at the scene in Bushey in July PA Man in court charged with murders of family of BBC’s John Hunt John Hunt and Carol Hunt, Hannah Hunt (top right) and Louise Hunt Supplied ✕ Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

This pretty town is tucked away in a stunning bay along the Mediterranean coast, offering a combination of gentle sea, rugged mountains and lush greenery. People are drawn here for nature; the mountains are ideal for hiking and exploring, with trails embedded into peaceful valleys and pathways that lead to panoramic viewpoints and hidden coves. There’s also a scenic coastal promenade between Içmeler and Marmaris for those who don’t want to venture up into the mountains. You can stroll or rent bikes to explore the route, with plenty of places to stop for authentic Turkish cuisine and ice cream along the way. Family-friendly boat trips are a fabulous way to get to know the nearby islands and surrounding bays. Kids will love the dolphin-watching tours and island-hopping boat rides, where you can swim and snorkel throughout the day. Boat trips are an excellent way to get to know Içmeler’s nearby islands and surrounding bays ( Shutterstock ) If you want a more authentic adventure, opt for an excursion on a classic Turkish gulet and experience a traditional part of Turkey’s maritime culture. Most boat trips come with lunch or dinner, usually including a feast of fresh seafood and Turkish specialities, as well as stops for swimming and snorkelling and ample family-friendly activities.

Although there aren’t many left these days, historically, people would visit the town to drink and bathe in the spring waters because of their natural curing powers. You can, however, visit the ancient ruins of Hierapolis to see mysterious stone moments and take a dip in the warm mineral springs for yourself. It’s said to be where Cleopatra, the last queen of ancient Egypt, bathed thousands of years ago. Içmeler Beach has been awarded Blue Flag status, making it a popular spot for swimming and frolicking in the sea. There’s also a gentle slope, meaning the water gets gradually deeper with no unexpected drop-offs, so it’s super safe for children. Rent a couple of sunbeds and spend the day soaking up the sun, or get stuck into water sports. The area is a water sporting hotspot offering jet skiing, parasailing, pedalos, wakeboarding, banana boating and more. Although Içmeler Beach is the most popular beach in the town, there are also more secluded beaches and coves along the coast near Maramis, perfect for a more private experience. Içmeler Beach has been awarded Blue Flag status and is a very popular spot for swimmers and seaside frolickers ( Shutterstock ) If you want a break from leisurely beach bathing and sun-soaking, there are a couple of nearby waterparks to keep the kids entertained and your thrills topped up. Marmaris Aqua Dream Waterpark, up in the hills, is the biggest in the area, boasting countless themed rides and an epic wave pool. Atlantis Water Park is another beachside park, home to several slides, a kids’ pool, a wave pool, mini golf, soft play areas, restaurants, and bars.

Read our privacy policy I realised how much I hated Lime bikes when a friend asked me to meet her for a swim one evening. The location was an issue. In London, there are certain spots that are incredibly easy to travel to on public transport despite being on polar opposite sides of the city. Waterloo to West Hampstead. Shepherds Bush to Liverpool Street. Stockwell to literally anywhere. Then there are places that, despite being close to each other on a map, are practically impossible to travel to. Call them TfL black holes, if you will, where travelling from A to B will involve several train lines and buses. The journey from my flat to this particular lido was one such crater. “It will take me about 45 minutes to get there and I can’t justify paying for a £25 Uber,” I texted my friend. “Obviously just get a Lime?” she replied. “It’s 15 mins.” I sighed. The assumption that anybody and everybody travels around London via Lime bikes had once again come back to bite me. “I don’t use those,” I wrote, knowing what was coming next: questions, confusion, and a lot of laughter emojis. Yes, I know Lime bikes are faster. Yes, I know they’re more efficient. And yes, I know it makes more sense. But I’m still not getting on one of them. Among my friends, I’m one of the few who doesn’t get around London via a hideous green bicycle. There are roughly 30,000 of the bikes on our streets and, as far as I’m concerned, the people using them are all a part of one big, lime-y cult. And when I read that Brent Council is plotting to ban them entirely, I felt relief. Finally! I have confirmation I’m not alone in despising these things… Lime began its operations in London in 2018, having been founded a year earlier in San Francisco. At the time, they were sold as a sustainable and efficient addition to the city’s transport links, as opposed to a daily blight for all commuters. I’ve been resistant to them since their arrival and not, I should clarify, because I can’t ride a bike. I can, I promise. I’m also not against the idea of cycling, per se – it’s definitely far better from an environmental perspective. No. The first reason I haven’t joined the Lime cult is because I don’t drive. I have a licence that I obtained at the age of 17 for no reason other than the fact that all my friends were getting theirs – I’m from London and have never found the need for a car. Plus, I can’t really afford one. So the roads are slightly unfamiliar to me, at least in the sense that I don’t feel confident trying to navigate them on a bike. The second reason is sweat. Surely all this cycling means you arrive everywhere feeling a little bit hot and flustered? Not that the Tube is much better, by the way, particularly in the summer. But at least I can travel with one of those electric little fans that keeps you cool. There’s also the limitation placed on clothing. Travelling by bike imposes some outfit restrictions that I’d find quite hard to square: short dresses and skirts aren’t exactly the most cycling-appropriate ensemble. Plus I find the idea of bringing a change of clothes just a bit of a faff. Where do you get changed? How much earlier will I need to arrive at places in order to change? The third and main explanation, though, is that I just don’t think it’s very safe. Nobody I know who uses Lime bikes rides them with a helmet – why is there no law requiring cyclists to do so? And I’ve seen the way people drive in this city: recklessly and with a hostility towards cyclists not unlike my own. It’s dangerous. open image in gallery Piles of strewn-about Lime bikes are a familiar sight in modern London ( Getty ) On top of all this, though, there are other mounting concerns about Lime bikes brewing in circles far beyond my own stubborn little brain. You don’t have to look far in London to find stacks of them scattered haphazardly across pavements, causing trouble for pedestrians, particularly those who are elderly or those who use wheelchairs. As a result of this, Brent could be the first UK council to ban Lime bikes entirely, with Muhammed Butt, the Brent Council leader, calling for change in order to better regulate them. He’s suggested dedicating parking bays for them, as well as introducing fines for users who abandon their e-bikes in the wrong location. “The nuisance they’re causing [...] they’re just being left with no care and attention,” Butt said on Radio 4’s Today programme last week. There have also been incidents of bikes falling onto parked cars and causing serious damage, while one photograph circulating social media showed one lodged in a tree. Banning them sounds like the obvious solution – but perhaps all that’s needed is better regulation. Other councils have already implemented dedicated parking bays for Lime bikes, so perhaps it’s only a matter of time until others follow suit. More cycling lanes across the city would be helpful, too. Even if all this does happen, I still won’t be jumping on board. I know it’s in my best interests – and given the no-driving thing and total lack of road awareness, I suspect it’s in everyone else’s best interests as well.

Read our privacy policy Dave Navarro has issued a joint statement with his Jane’s Addiction bandmates Eric Avery and Stephen Perkins, after the rock band cancelled their tour following an onstage bust-up involving frontman Perry Farrell . The guitarist had remained largely silent after the incident last week – in which the singer threw a punch at him in the middle of a live show – with the exception of a cryptic message shared from his Instagram. A full statement has since been shared by Navarro and signed off by his two bandmates, bassist Avery and drummer Perkins, informing fans that they saw no alternative to cancelling the tour after Friday’s shocking scenes. “Due to a continuing pattern of behaviour and the mental health difficulties of our singer Perry Farrell, we have come to the conclusion that we have no choice but to discontinue the current US tour,” the statement, posted late on Monday 16 September, said. “Our concern for his personal health and safety as well as our own has left us no alternative. We hope that he will find the help he needs. “We deeply regret that we are not able to come through for all our fans who have already bought tickets. We can see no solution that would either ensure a safe environment on stage or reliably allow us to deliver a great performance on a nightly basis. “Our hearts are broken. Dave, Eric and Stephen.” On Friday 13 September, the band’s reunion gig at the Leader Bank Pavilion in Boston ended in chaos after Farrell began shouting at Navarro midway through the performance. Evidently angry, he then proceeded to shove the guitarist and throw a punch before being dragged away by Avery and several crew members. Navarro was widely praised for his calm response, with footage showing him standing still and placing a hand on Farrell’s chest in an attempt to get him to back off.

In a brief statement issued on Monday (September 16), the group said: “The band have made the difficult decision to take some time away as a group. As such, they will be cancelling the remainder of the tour.” In a separate statement to The Independent , Farrell added: “This weekend has been incredibly difficult and after having the time and space to reflect, it is only right that I apologise to my bandmates, especially Dave Navarro, fans, family and friends for my actions during Friday’s show. “Unfortunately, my breaking point resulted in inexcusable behavior, and I take full accountability for how I chose to handle the situation.” More about Jane's Addiction Join our commenting forum Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies Comments 1 / 2 Dave Navarro issues fresh statement after Jane’s Addiction cancel tour Dave Navarro issues fresh statement after Jane’s Addiction cancel tour Perry Farrell was involved in an altercation with his Jane’s Addiction bandmate Dave Navarro X/Twitter Dave Navarro issues fresh statement after Jane’s Addiction cancel tour Jane’s Addiction have cancelled their remaining tour dates after an altercation between frontman Perry Farrell (right) and guitarist Dave Navarro Getty ✕ Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Read our privacy policy Coldplay have announced that they will perform eight stadium shows in London and Hull next year, signalling their only live UK and European performances for 2025. The British pop-rock band, who headlined Glastonbury Festival in June , recently completed their huge 2024 European tour in support of their latest album, Music of the Spheres. The new dates will follow the release of their forthcoming 10th record, Moon Music, scheduled for release on 4 October. Announcing the new shows on Tuesday (17 September), Coldplay revealed that 50 per cent of tickets to the band’s first ever shows in Hull would go to local fans with the postcodes HU, YO, DN or LN, when they go on sale via Ticketmaster and Seetickets at 9am on Friday 27 September. A pre-sale will be open to fans who order Moon Music from the official Coldplay UK or EU stores; those who have already pre-ordered the album from the UK or EU store will be automatically eligible. The pre-sale begins at 9am on Thursday 26 September. In a surprise for the music industry, Coldplay have also announced that 10 per cent of the band’s proceeds from the sale will be donated to the Music Venue Trust, a charitable organisation that supports UK grassroots music venues and emerging artists. The band first shared the news by placing a poster in the window of the Dublin Castle in Camden, London, the scene of their first ever live gig in February 1988. Social media users are speculating what this poster featured on Coldplay's Instagram stories could mean for Hull 👀 The band shared posters from their first ever gig at the Dublin Castle in 1998, when they were called The Coldplay with some extra notes. pic.twitter.com/SyW1P2DWTg — BBC East Yorkshire (@looknorthBBC) September 16, 2024 Donations to the Music Venue Trust will also be made by concert promoters SJM Concerts, Metropolis Music and Live Nation; the band’s booking agent WME; the venues Wembley Stadium and Hull Craven Park; and the official ticket agents, Ticketmaster , See Tickets and AXS. Mark Davyd, CEO of the Music Venue Trust, said in a statement: “Coldplay are the perfect example of a UK band who came through the grassroots circuit on their way to worldwide stadium-filling success. “It’s fantastic to see them celebrating their own pathway to Wembley by giving back to the grassroots music venues that supported them and recognising the artists and promoters that are struggling more than ever to build their own careers.

After months of discussing Coldplay’s potential support around these UK shows with them, we’re so happy and grateful that the news is finally out there!” In another world first for a stadium show, Coldplay have pledged to power the production for their Wembley shows with 100 per cent solar, wind and kinetic energy, collected at the venue and elsewhere in the UK and delivered by a specially designed electric battery system. In June, Coldplay revealed that their Music of the Spheres show had, at that point, produced 59 per cent less CO2e emissions than their previous stadium tour between 2016 to 2017. The band have also overseen the planting of nine million trees, with a further one million to be planted before the end of the year. Coldplay are expanding their sustainability efforts to their album: physical copies of Moon Music will be made from 100 per cent recycled plastic bottles.

Exclusive: Demand for ETA is at odds with the easing of Brexit rules to allow children to arrive with ID cards Simon Calder Travel Correspondent Tuesday 17 September 2024 09:32 Comments Article bookmarked Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Don't show me this message again ✕ Papers please: only passports, not ID cards, are admissible with the new UK Electronic Travel Authorisation system ( Simon Calder ) Sign up to our free Brexit and beyond email for the latest headlines on what Brexit is meaning for the UK Sign up to our Brexit email for the latest insight Sign up to our Brexit email for the latest insight Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our privacy policy “You will find destinations like Hastings absolutely decimated by a lack of school visits”: so MPs were told by Patricia Yates, chief executive of VisitBritain . The inbound tourism leader was giving evidence in 2022 to the DCMS Select Committee about the devastating impact of the post- Brexit decision to ban foreign visitors who have only identity cards, not passports. Since EU citizens can visit dozens of other countries with their ID cards , many choose not to go to the extra expense and trouble of obtaining a passport. “Getting school visits in, which I cannot see as a huge risk, would be a major boost for the industry which is really suffering at the moment,” Ms Yates continued. In 2023, in one of the first acts by the Conservative government in reversing the harm caused to the UK tourism industry by Brexit, French school groups were told they could be admitted with only identity cards . But the new Labour government appears to be doubling down on the anti-ID card move by insisting the new Electronic Travel Authorisation ( ETA ) can only be linked to passports. From 2 April 2025, arrivals from Europe to the UK – apart from British and Irish citizens – must apply in advance for an ETA, price £10. Announcing the requirement, the minister for Migration and Citizenship, Seema Malhotra, said: “The worldwide expansion of the ETA demonstrates our commitment to enhance security through new technology and embedding a modern immigration system.” The government is clear that by 2 April 2025 European visitors to the UK “will need an electronic travel authorisation” and that ETAs are “digitally linked to a traveller’s passport”. Because the system is based solely on inbound travellers having passports, not identity cards, the special status of French school group visits to the UK appears in jeopardy. The Home Office says the implications of the policy for school groups of the new policy are “under review”. The inbound travel industry has sustained a loss of business since former home secretary Priti Patel banned ID cards in October 2021 . The decision excludes around 300 million EU citizens who have identity cards rather than passports. Joss Croft, chief executive of UKinbound said: “The introduction of ETAs has been in the pipeline for a number of years and in this time, we have seen passport-free travel introduced for French school groups. “The previous government were looking to expand this scheme to other European countries, and we hope this plan is still in the pipeline.” But unless the government changes its insistence that ETAs can only be issued against passports, and that every visitor must have the online permit, it is difficult to see how French school groups will be able to visit the UK without every member of the party having a passport. In addition, ferry links between France and the Channel Islands could be in jeopardy by the cancellation of a special deal allowing French day-trippers to visit Jersey, Guernsey and Alderney with only ID cards. The Channel Islands are not part of the UK, but their immigration controls align. As a result they stand to be adversely affected by the demand for all Continental European visitors to enrol for the ETA scheme. The islands were hit hard by the last government banning entry by French citizens who have identity cards but not passports. The number of visits halved, jeopardising ferry links from French ports to Jersey, Guernsey and Alderney. The islands negotiated an agreement with UK ministers to allow French nationals to visit for the day with just their ID cards. But from the end of 2025 that option is set to be withdrawn. While the Channel Islands are self-governing, they routinely follow the policies of the UK Home Office on immigration procedures. The ID card ban had a devastating impact on the day-trip business from French tourists. The collapse in revenue led to fears that ferry links from France to Guernsey and Jersey could be unsustainable. But in another easing of the identity card exclusion, the islands were given the option to allow French daytrippers to visit. That option now appears in jeopardy beyond the end of next year. A spokesperson for Jersey Customs and Immigration Service said: “The scheme won’t impact visitors travelling directly to Jersey until the end of 2025.” Anyone travelling to the Channel Islands via the UK will need an ETA from 2 April 2025. The Home Office says in its latest release about the ETA : “The government is taking major steps towards delivering its ambitious aim to digitise the UK border and immigration system. “ETAs are digitally linked to a traveller’s passport and ensure more robust security checks are carried out before people begin their journey to the UK, helping to prevent abuse of our immigration system.” A celebration of Brexit benefits for travellers, as championed by the last government More about Brexit Hastings ID cards VisitBritain eta Home Office Join our commenting forum Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies Comments 1 / 1 Are England’s seaside resorts at risk of being ‘decimated’ again?

Read our privacy policy Extreme weather is sweeping across Europe with catastrophic flooding caused by Storm Boris that may reach Italy while five thousand firefighters are struggling to contain wildfires in Portugal . Hot, dry conditions behind the fire outbreaks in Portugal came while downpours were concurrently causing flooding in central Europe. Heavy rain is expected over much of Italy over the next few days, with the region of Emilia-Romagna and Lazio under yellow weather alerts. Six people have died, including four firefighters, in northern Portugal and an unknown number of people have been forced to flee their homes.

The Independent has asked the main airlines flying to and from the region – British Airways, easyJet, Ryanair and Wizz Air – whether they will allow passengers to fly home earlier without penalty. Ryanair said: “Passengers have the option of making changes to their bookings online up to 2.5 hours prior to the scheduled departure time of the original or new flight. “If a passenger is away or needs to return urgently, they can do so by contacting our customer service team who will try help any passengers looking to return as soon as possible.” Vehicles are partially covered by water during floods in Ostrava, Czech Republic, ( The Associated Press ) EasyJet said normal policies will be imposed – with a change fee and any difference in fare imposed. Such costs may be recoverable from a travel insurer, depending on the circumstances. I have a flight booked to the area and want to switch destination or postpone my trip. Can I? The airlines have been asked that question and again, in the absence of responses you must assume that you would lose some or all of your cash. The exception is if you are booked on a package holiday and the trip cannot go ahead as planned because of flooding. In that case, the organiser of the trip should provide a full refund. I have a rental property booked – will I be able to claim a refund? That depends on the terms that you agreed with the property owner, and whether they will allow any latitude because of the floods.

Read our privacy policy Controversial plans to build a “mega-resort” on the banks of Scotland’s Loch Lomond have been rejected by the national park authority, prompting celebrations from campaigners. Theme park operator Flamingo Land first announced its bid for a £40m development in 2018, which included two hotels , a restaurant, more than 100 lodges, a waterpark and monorail. But the proposal sparked widespread opposition, both locally and nationally, with more than 174,000 signing a petition objecting to the plans. Representatives of the theme park and supporters of the development argued it would bring significant economic investment to the area and generate up to 200 jobs. But on Monday evening (16 September), Loch Lomond & The Trossachs National Park authority board unanimously voted against the development, ruling that it did not comply with environmental and nature conservation policies. Concerns were raised about flood risks , the loss of areas of ancient woodland, increased traffic, detrimental impact on local businesses and conflict with the national park’s conservation aims. More than 100 people attended the hearing on Monday evening at Lomond Parish Church in Balloch to hear the decision. Scottish Green MSP Ross Greer , who led the campaign against the resort, called the result “a huge victory”. He said: “This has been one of those classic David and Goliath battles from the start, with the small community of Balloch up against this very well-funded developer who stretched out the process for a decade. “The single biggest issue people had was the sheer scale of the development. Local residents are already struggling with visitor numbers and there was acute concern from local independent businesses that they would be displaced.” He added: “After this defeat, I’m calling on Flamingo Land to drop their plans for good and end this decade-long saga. Local council representatives told the meeting they were “fatigued” by the long-running debate over the project, which was first proposed in 2018. Stuart Pearce, director of place for the Loch Lomond park authority, said it created “unacceptable risk” of flooding of the River Leven. Flamingo Land representative Fiona Robertson insisted it would have created a “significant” amount of economic growth and jobs, however. The family-owned company set up the original Flamingo Land in North Yorkshire in 1959, with the motto: “Wild Animals, Wilder Rides.” Elsewhere, interim moderator at Lomond Parish Church of Scotland, Reverend Ian Miller, said that “if there is any increase in employment, I've got to vote for it for their sake”. Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park attracts more than four million visitors per year. While the picturesque lochs, forests and mountains that are integral to Scottish identity attract visitors from around the globe, the park’s communities face the risk of a declining and ageing population and the loss of some local services.

Read our privacy policy The cost of a cup of coffee is likely to rise after key producers like Brazil and Vietnam were struck by extreme weather. Arabica coffee futures in New York surged to a 13-year high of over $2.60 per pound on Monday, driven by record-breaking drought in Brazil and the destruction caused by Typhoon Yagi in Vietnam. The prices for the premium coffee beans have surged roughly by 40 per cent this year, according to Bloomberg . Meanwhile there has also been a shortage of the cheaper robusta beans. The surge comes as there are rising fears over shortages in global supply after threats to some of the coffee crops in key producers. Brazil, the world’s largest producer of arabica coffee, is grappling with a severe drought. In the country’s Minas Gerais region, which produces almost a third of Brazil's arabica coffee, rainfall has been well below normal, according to Somar Meteorologia, Brazil’s national weather agency. This drought is threatening the 2025 to 2026 arabica crop, which, according to Carlos Mera, an agri-commodities analyst at Rabobank, “is hanging by a thread.” River dwellers carry water gallons, on the sandbanks of the Madeira river, to bring to the isolated region of Paraizinho community, during the worst drought of the river in history, Humaita, Amazonas state, Brazil September 8, 2024. REUTERS/Bruno Kelly ( REUTERS/Bruno Kelly ) Mr Mera told Bloomberg that this crisis is compounded by logistical challenges like port congestion and a global shortage of shipping containers, which are hampering the movement of coffee worldwide. In Vietnam, the world’s largest producer of robusta coffee, Typhoon Yagi devastated the country’s coffee-growing regions, killing more than 200 people and damaging large swaths of farmland. Robusta coffee, which is typically used in instant coffee, is already in short supply, with damages adding pressure to global coffee prices. Flood-affected residents wait for a rescue boat to arrive in Taungoo, Myanmar's Bago region ( AFP via Getty Images ) The price of a cup of coffee has already surged in recent months with retailers like JM Smucker, the company behind brands like Dunkin’ and Café Bustelo, raising prices twice in recent months to offset the increase in green coffee costs. The company attributed these price hikes to “recent higher green coffee costs and the pass-through nature of the coffee category,” according to Bloomberg. In the UK, Pret A Manger has discontinued its popular coffee subscription service that allowed customers up to five barista-made drinks per day, the outlet said. The recent price hikes underscore a much larger issue: coffee production is increasingly under threat from climate crisis . A man walking in a coffee farm in Plei Bau Can in Vietnam’s central highlands, Gia Lai province ( AFP via Getty Images ) Coffee is grown in more than 40 countries within the narrow tropical “bean belt” that stretches along the equator. However, as temperatures rise and weather becomes more unpredictable, many of these regions are becoming less suitable for coffee cultivation. Climate models predict that areas suitable for coffee farming could shrink by up to 50 per cent by 2050. In Brazil, this figure could be as high as 80 per cent, threatening the country’s dominant role in global coffee production. By 2080, wild coffee, an important genetic resource for farmers, could become extinct. Over 120 million people worldwide rely on coffee farming for their livelihoods. Arabica coffee, which is prized for its flavor, is especially vulnerable to temperature changes. It grows best at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,000 metres and requires specific temperature ranges between 18C and 23C. When temperatures rise above these limits, coffee plants experience heat stress, reducing crop yields. Robusta coffee, which is more heat-tolerant, still faces challenges due to its high water requirements. With droughts becoming more frequent, even robusta farms are struggling to maintain output without increased irrigation. The situation is worsened by the limited genetic diversity of coffee crops. Arabica and robusta varieties account for 99 per cent of the world’s coffee production, making the crop highly vulnerable to pests, diseases, and climate crisis. While researchers are working to develop more resilient coffee strains, the wild species needed for breeding are under threat. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), more than 60 per cent of wild coffee species are at risk of extinction, limiting the potential for genetic improvements.

BBC 5 Live’s newest presenter, Matt Chorley, set him the trial as they sat side by side. Sir Ed embraced stunts during the general election campaign earlier this year and rode a different roller coaster shortly after launching the Lib Dem manifesto . Amusingly, he did not mention himself during the latest challenge and managed to name 16 MPs as the G-force hit. “Can we go again?” Sir Ed asked at the end of the ride.

Read our privacy policy The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has urged those receiving the Employment Support Allowance (ESA) to take immediate action as it overhauls the benefits system. Individuals claiming ESA will need to put in an application for Universal Credit , as the DWP phases out the allowance - a benefit for people who are unable to work as a result of sickness or disability . The DWP will substitute ESA with Universal Credit, but this change will not happen automatically for claimants, who they have urged to apply for the benefit. ESA recipients who have disabilities and health conditions often also receive Personal Independence Payments (PIP) , a benefit for people with long-term health conditions who face extra health related costs. The DWP is carrying out a major simplification of the benefits system ( PA ) Migration notices were sent out by the DWP in September, informing ESA recipients of a three-month window in which they need to secure their application for Universal Credit. If the switch is not made in the allocated time period payments will be halted, Birmingham Live reported. Six legacy benefits are being retired by the DWP with Universal Credit taking its place, as the DWP attempts a significant simplification of the benefits system. PIP is not changing as part of the DWP plans. Income Support, Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA), Housing Benefit, Working Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit will also be replaced in the major overhaul to the benefits system. With the festive period approaching in three months, ESA recipients will need to migrate to Universal Credit promptly if they wish to avoid any disruption during the Christmas season. The Government has advised recipients of legacy benefits: ""Move to Universal Credit if you get a migration notice letter. As one or more of your benefits will be ending soon, you need to move to Universal Credit."" ""To continue receiving financial support you must claim Universal Credit by the deadline date given in your letter. This is three months from the date the letter was sent out.""

Read our privacy policy W hat makes Wendy Cope one of the nation’s most loved poets ? Many things: her unpretentious, accessible style; her sense of humour; her hard-won wisdom; and the fact that, running beneath these poems that are such a pleasure to read, is often an iceberg-like swell of deep emotion. Recently Cope told The Times, “if you want people to enjoy poetry, then it’s kind of nice to write poems they can understand.” And a whole new generation has begun to relate to and connect with them. Last year, one of her most famous poems, “The Orange”, went viral on TikTok, leading to a new edition of her work being released. This week, for the first time, her poetry is being published in a collected edition, with over three decades of writing in one volume. Here she shares an insight into her reading and writing life... What is on your “to be read” pile? Is it under control or out of hand? In book form: Politics on the Edge by Rory Stewart, Table for Two by Amor Towles, The Letters of Emily Dickinson . On my Kindle: Stardust by Joseph Kanon, Death at the Sign of the Rook by Kate Atkinson, Lost and Never Found by Simon Mason. And a few more. In this house books are out of control. They aren’t all mine. The best book I’ve read so far this year... A few months ago I discovered Joseph Kanon and I have now read almost all his books. Among the best are Defectors (set in Moscow in 1961), Los Alamos (with Oppenheimer as a character) and The Good German (post-war Berlin). His work is historical fiction with brilliant descriptions of place and gripping plots. Wendy Cope’s ‘Collected Poems’ is the first single volume of her work ( Faber ) The first book I ever loved obsessively... The Pooh books and, a few years later, the works of Nigel Molesworth (written by Geoffrey Willans). All because they made me laugh so much. They still do. The book I’d save from a burning building... The leather-bound complete works of Shakespeare passed on to me by my father. He gave it to me when I was doing A-level English. I wrote a poem about it (in my book Anecdotal Evidence ). The book that surprised me the most... A Shropshire Lad by AE Housman. For years I was put off by the title. Then a poet friend urged me to read it and it was a revelation. Housman has been one of my favourite poets ever since. The author who has taught me the most... Ian D Suttie, author of The Origins of Love and Hate . I read it when I was a student and it gave me a lot of insight into my unhappiness and what might be done about it. It was the beginning of a path that led to my entering psychoanalysis a few years later. My favourite place to read... In my armchair in our living room, where I have a reading stand for the sake of my neck. And in bed late at night, where I read from a Kindle. Different books upstairs and downstairs. Greg Wise and Emma Thompson in ‘Sense and Sensibility’ ( Columbia Pictures ) The book I’ve written that means the most to me personally is... The Orange and Other Poems . My poem “The Orange” went viral on TikTok and my publishers followed that up with a lovely little volume. It has sold faster than any of my other books and been a wonderful stroke of luck. The best thing a reader has said to me – and the worst... Earlier this year I had a letter from a man who was dying, saying how much my poems had meant to him over the years, and thanking me. The worst thing? Being asked, in a rude and aggressive way, “What’s the secret of getting your poems published?” This has happened more than once. My answer is “Get better at writing”. Favourite bookshop (and why?) Topping & Company in Ely. When we moved to Ely this was an unexpected bonus. Great stock, lovely staff. It’s as least as good as any of the bookshops in nearby Cambridge. Is the book always better than the film? Usually. But I can think of films that came close – the 1992 David Copperfield , for example, and a couple of Jane Austen films: Emma starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Sense and Sensibility with Emma Thompson. ‘Collected Poems’ is out now, published by Faber More about Poetry Join our commenting forum Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies Comments 1 / 3 Writers on reading: Poet Wendy Cope on the books that matter to her Writers on reading: Poet Wendy Cope on the books that matter to her Wendy Cope’s ‘Collected Poems’ is the first single volume of her work Faber Writers on reading: Poet Wendy Cope on the books that matter to her Greg Wise and Emma Thompson in ‘Sense and Sensibility’ 1995 Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.

Read our privacy policy Eight people have been killed and thousands of Hezbollah members wounded across Lebanon after their pagers suddenly exploded , officials said. The Lebanese health ministry suggested that eight people had been killed and around 2, 750 injured, 200 critically so, as a result of the explosions. In a statement, Hezbollah claimed that three people had been killed, including “a girl and two brothers”. The Independent could not immediately verify this claim, but the family of a Hezbollah member told Agence France-Presse that their 10-year-old daughter had been killed in Lebanon’s east. Another official from the group said the son of one of Hezbollah’s prominent legislators, Ali Ammar Mahdi, was killed when the device he was carrying exploded. A Hezbollah official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the detonation of the pagers, which took place at 3.30pm local time, was the “biggest security breach” the group had been subjected to in nearly a year of war with Israel . In one video, a man could be seen falling to the floor after a sudden blast while he was picking fruit in a busy market as people fled the area. The Iranian ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, was injured by one of the blasts, Iran’s Mehr news agency reported. In their statement, Hezbollah added that they are “conducting a wide-ranging security and scientific investigation to determine the causes that led to these simultaneous explosions”. Lebanese army soldiers stand guard in Beirut after explosions were reported across the country ( AFP/Getty ) The pagers that detonated were the latest model brought in by Hezbollah in recent months, three security sources said. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been exchanging fire with Hezbollah since last October in parallel with it’s war with Hamas, who control the Gaza Strip. The explosions come after Israel claimed it had killed top Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in an airstrike in the Lebanese capital of Beirut in July. Several other senior officials were killed on strikes on the Iranian embassy in the Syrian capital of Damascus. Hezbollah, which controls southern Lebanon, forms part of Iran’s so-called “axis of resistance”, which opposes Western and Israeli influence in the region. The group opened a second front against Israel a day after the war in the Gaza Strip began, triggered by a Hamas attack inside Israel on 7 October. A wounded man is carried onto an ambulance after his pager exploded in Lebanon ( AP ) Hamas, also backed by Tehran, killed around 1,200 people, with another 251 taken hostage. In response, Israel has bombarded Gaza from the air and ground. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the offensive, health officials in the strip have said. It has displaced nearly 90 per cent of the territory’s 2.3 million population. On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu‘s office said the safe return of its citizens to their homes near the border with Lebanon had been added to the government’s formal war aims. “The Security Cabinet has updated the objectives of the war to include the following: Returning the residents of the north securely to their homes. Israel will continue to act to implement this objective,” a statement said. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced from towns and villages on both sides of the border by near-daily exchanges between the Israeli military and Hezbollah. An ambulance rushes wounded people to a hospital in Beirut on September after the blasts ( AFP/Getty ) Israel has said it would prefer a diplomatic solution that would see Hezbollah moved farther back from the border. However, Hezbollah, which also says it wants to avoid all-out conflict, says that only an end to the war in Gaza will stop the fighting. Gaza ceasefire efforts are deadlocked after months of faltering talks mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States. The “axis of resistance” comprises a group of violent proxies across Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon and Palestine, coordinated by Iran’s Quds Force, the foreign arm of the IRGC. The Quds Force’s aim is to export Iran’s 1979 Islamic revolution abroad. The US assassinated the former head of the Quds Force, Qassem Solemaini, in January 2020.

Read our privacy policy A breakthrough has been made in the search for a hiker who vanished without a trace on a Colorado mountain almost 20 years ago. Michelle Vanek, 35, a mother of four , was last seen two decades ago while hiking to the summit of the Mountain of the Holy Cross in Minturn with her friend Eric Sawyer. The pair were almost at their destination when Vanek started to feel tired and decided to head back down. Sawyer continued making his way to the peak, hoping to catch his friend during his descent, but she was never seen again. In the years since, only a single boot belonging to the missing hiker was found. But, after renewed efforts from five women in the Vail Mountain Rescue Group and a female archeologist from the U.S Forest Service, many personal items including clothing, a small backpack, hiking poles and a set of keys matching the car Vanek was driving that day have recently been recovered. The items will now all be sent for DNA and forensic analysis. “It was important for us to have a women’s perspective at the top of the mountain which had not been done before,” Emily Brown, a member of the search party, told 9news . Vanek was exhausted as she approached the summit, she told her hiking companion in 2005 ( CBI ) “Our president Scott Beebe had a dream last year that he though Michelle’s remains or soul did not want to be found by a male.” Vanek’s disappearance on September 24, 2005, sparked a large-scale, seven-day search that involved 220 people. It was, at the time, the largest search in Colorado history, but sadly proved to be inconclusive as no evidence was uncovered, Vail Daily reported. Vail Mountain Rescue search commander Tim Cochrane told Vail Daily at the time: “It’s truly a mystery as to where Michelle is. “That’s probably the most baffling thing — we’ve put five different search dogs where we know she was — and they haven’t found anything.” Michelle Vanek never returned home after a hike to the Mountain of the Holy Cross (pictured), Colorado, in 2005 ( Getty Images/iStockphoto ) Ever since her disappearance in 2005, police marked Vanek as a cold case on file. Nearly 20 years later, Eagle County Sheriff’s Office believes the recent discovery “offers a glimpse” into Vanek’s final moments on the mountain. “The search team never lost sight of the goal to bring Michelle home,” they said . 20-years-later, a female-led search team recovered items belonging to the missing woman ( CBI ) “Each item serves as a reminder of the strength of the human spirit, the unwavering dedication of these volunteers, and the enduring hope of a family waiting for answers. “While these items are undergoing forensic testing to confirm their connection to Michelle, the emotional weight of this discovery is already deeply felt. “These personal items are tangible connections to a life that touched so many. “This discovery offers a moment of hope for Michelle’s family, friends, and the volunteers who have worked tirelessly, even as they await further confirmation.” Police officials confirmed the area where her items were found will remain protected out of respect for Vanek’s memory and future search efforts.

Foreman, 27, arrived at the townhome of his ex-girlfriend, Jalen Whitlock, who had thrown a birthday party for her six-year-old child with her current boyfriend, according to Houston police. Whitlock and Foreman shared custody of the child and a two-year-old they had together. Whitlock’s boyfriend, who was not identified, was attending the event as well. Witnesses told police they saw Foreman arrive at the home and attempt to drop off presents for his children. However, Whitlock told him not to come to the party. When Foreman arrived at the home, the woman’s boyfriend answered the door, KHOU reported. The children came downstairs to get their gifts but a fight broke out between the two men, police said. Foreman then went to his car, a white Chevrolet Tahoe, to retrieve a firearm and yelled, “we’re going to end this now.” He then fired five shots at the home.

Read our privacy policy Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has sparked a fierce backlash among employees after announcing they’ll now be required to spend five days a week in the office. Jassy sent a memo to staff on Monday informing them of “a couple changes we’re making to further strengthen our culture and teams.” Part of doing that, he said, is returning to working in the office full time, as was the norm before the Covid-19 pandemic. Explaining the move, he said: “When we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant.” Staff have flocked to internal Slack channels to protest against the new rule, according to Business Insider , which said employees are “burning” with comments and reactions. In reference to the multinational technology giant’s famous leadership principles, one person rhetorically asked: “What ever happened to ‘Striving to be Earth’s Best Employer.’” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced that workers would have to be in the office full time, instead of three days a week ( Getty Images for The New York Times ) ""Please do note that this is (in a lot of cases) significantly more strict and out of its mind than many teams operated under pre-covid,” wrote another on Slack. “This is not ‘going back’ to how it was before. It’s just going backwards.” Others have taken to social media to voice their grievances and concerns with the move. “You mean to tell me you wouldn’t want to spend 5 days/week under fluorescent lighting and no sense of time?” sarcastically cracked one X user. “Some of you don’t want it bad enough.” Another wrote: “Seriously Amazon! Soon as folks begin having a truly better work life balance, you decide you want folks back in the office 5 days a week. SMH…” Others accused Amazon of making the change to push people out and avoid layoffs. “Layoffs. Without payouts,” read one post. “It’a cheaper/easier than doing another rd [round] of mass layoffs...” said another user. The Independent has reached out to Amazon for comment. Amazon’s CEO is facing backlash both from workers and social media ( Nicholas.T.Ansell/PA Wire ) The new rule, set to take effect on January 2, 2025, comes seven months after Jassy announced that it would be mandatory for corporate workers to work on-site at least three days a week. He said in Monday’s memo that the “last 15 months we’ve been back in the office at least three days a week has strengthened our conviction about the benefits.” Jassy did note that if employees are reasonably unable to make their way into work, such as having children who are unwell, then working from home remains as a backup option. Amazon has made headlines for years with allegations of poor working conditions for employees, particularly those toiling in warehouses. One worker at a site in India claimed that warehouse employees were allegedly asked to work continuously without breaks in order to meet their targets on May 16. In Birmingham, UK, over 60 workers went on strike this year over pay and working conditions.

Read our privacy policy The mother of ballerina Michaela DePrince has died the day after her daughter’s shock death. Michaela, 29, died on 10 September while her mother Elaine died during a routine procedure in preparation for surgery the next day, their family has confirmed. An orphan of war in Sierra Leone , Michaela moved to the United States while still an infant and was adopted by Elaine at the age of four. Elaine did not know about her daughter’s death at the time of her procedure. A statement shared by a representative of the DePrince family said: “As unbelievable as it may seem, the two deaths were completely unrelated. “The only way we can make sense of the senseless is that Elaine, who had already lost three children many years ago, was by the grace of God spared the pain of experiencing the loss of a fourth child.” It continued: “What the family is going through right now is truly unimaginably painful. Grieving two family members who died within a 24 hour period is tragic and devastating.” In an earlier statement shared on Friday 20 September, the DePrince family said: “Michaela touched so many lives across the world, including ours. She was an unforgettable inspiration to everyone who knew her or heard her story. Michaela DePrince’s mother Elaine has died one day after her 29-year-old daughter’s shock death ( Ian Gavan/Getty Images ) “From her early life in war-torn Africa, to stages and screens across the world, she achieved her dreams and so much more.” Michaela was born Mabinty Bangura in Kenema, Sierra Leone on January 6, 1995. She grew up as an orphan from the age of three after her father was reportedly shot and killed by the Revolutionary United Front and her mother starved to death. In 1999 she was adopted by Elaine and Charles DePrince, and moved to Cherry Hill, New Jersey. Michaela went on to study classical ballet in the US, and was one of the stars of the 2011 documentary First Position , which followed six young dancers as they competed for a place at an elite ballet school. She made history by becoming the youngest principal dancer at the Dance Theatre of Harlem, before moving to the Netherlands to dance with the Dutch National Ballet. She then returned to the United States to dance with Boston Ballet. Michaela was adopted by Elaine at the age of four ( AP ) In 2012 she appeared on Dancing with the Stars , and in 2016 she choreographed her own dance moves to accompany the song “Freedom” on Beyoncé’s visual album Lemonade. “She said I looked like I was a creature from another planet,” DePrince told the Wall Street Journal about meeting the pop superstar. “She walked up to me and said, ‘It’s such an honor to have you here.’ I was really cheesy and said, ‘The honor is mine.’ I was on cloud nine.” Her 2014 memoir, Taking Flight: From War Orphan to Star Ballerina, which she co-authored with her adoptive mother has been published in 12 countries. In 2018 it was announced that Madonna was attached to direct a film adaptation. Boston Ballet paid tribute to DePrince following her death. “We’re sending our love and support to the family of Michaela Mabinty DePrince at this time of loss,” said their statement . “We were so fortunate to know Mabinty; she was a beautiful person, a wonderful dancer, and she will be greatly missed by us all.” More about Dancing With The Stars Beyonce Ballet Join our commenting forum Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies Comments 1 / 3 Michaela DePrince’s mother dies one day after ballet star’s death Michaela DePrince’s mother dies one day after ballet star’s death Michaela DePrince’s mother Elaine has died one day after her 29-year-old daughter’s shock death Ian Gavan/Getty Images Michaela DePrince’s mother dies one day after ballet star’s death Michaela was adopted by Elaine at the age of four Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Read our privacy policy A woman is challenging the rules of Miss America and Miss World that disqualify her and millions of others from entering. Danielle Hazel says that she’s always dreamed of entering the competitions but was devastated to learn that she’s no longer eligible because she had a son when she was just 19 years old. Under current rules, mothers are banned from entering beauty pageants. “When I told Zion, who is now six years old, about these rules he had an immediate gut reaction: he said that these rules are stupid,” she said, speaking at the Women’s Rights Pioneers Monument in New York’s Central Park. “His sense of fairness at only 6 years old tells him that this is unjust and makes no sense.” Hazel’s lawyer, Gloria Allred, said a complaint sent Monday to the city’s Commission on Human Rights seeks an end to the requirements because they deny and exclude mothers from an “important business and cultural opportunity” simply because of their status as parents. “As we stated in Danielle‘s filed complaint, this exclusion is degrading to Danielle as it is based upon the antiquated stereotype that women cannot be both a mother and be beautiful, poised, passionate, talented and philanthropic,” Allred said. Spokespersons for the Miss America and Miss World pageant organizations didn’t immediately respond to emails seeking comment Monday. A spokesperson for the human rights commission said the agency does not comment on open investigations. open image in gallery Flanked by Veronika Didusenko, left, and Danielle Hazel, right, attorney Gloria Allred, center, speaks during a news conference ( Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The discrimination complaint filed by Andrea Quiroga with the California Civil Rights Department prompted Miss Universe to eliminate its 70-year-old rule, which was imposed worldwide through its affiliated organizations, Allred said. “Being pregnant or being a parent is not a crime and should not exclude an individual from employment or business opportunities,” Allred said. “An individual’s status as a parent should not carry a stigma and no person should have to feel embarrassed, humiliated, or degraded because they have become a parent.” The two women were joined Monday by Veronika Didusenko, who was crowned Miss Ukraine 2018 only to have the title stripped when the Miss World organization learned that she had a child. Didusenko, who has since created an organization advocating for an end to beauty pageant bans on mothers, said she lost her legal challenge in Ukraine but is seeking relief from the European Court of Human Rights.

Read our privacy policy An experienced backpacker has been found dead two weeks after he was scheduled to return from a hike in Yosemite National Park . Kirk Thomas Olsen, a 61-year-old former park ranger, had set off on his backpacking trip across the Ostrander Lake Area, near Glacier Point, on August 23, according to the National Park Service. The 11.4-mile round-trip hike, which runs through pine forest to views of granite domes and Ostrander Lake, is known to be “strenuous” with a steep 1,500-foot (450 m) elevation gain, according to NPS. Olsen had only intended to be hiking for four days. But two weeks later, there was still no sign of the missing 61-year-old. On Saturday, Olsen’s body was found. National Park officials have not revealed his cause of death or where exactly his body was found. Olsen (right) pictured with his niece Holly Leeson (left) had been overdue for two weeks ( Holly Leeson/Facebook ) Olsen’s niece Holly Leeson said on Facebook that “Mother Nature” may have played a part in the tragedy. She had previously posted asking for help in finding her uncle. “He is an experienced hiker and former park ranger himself, and as a family, we are struggling to understand what has happened to him out there and any information would be very helpful to us!...” she wrote. In a follow-up post confirming his death, she wrote: “Thank you to everyone for the prayers and well wishes. “His body was found which is not the outcome we as a family hoped for but I would like to say a genuine thank you to Yosemite National Park for their diligent efforts to find him, and to this community for the support. “My late uncle was an experienced hiker and a former State Park ranger, unfortunately, Mother Nature in all of her glory does not account for past experience and solo hiking is never an endeavor that is without risks.” She urged other hikers to always travel with a companion to stay safe. As of this year, three individuals remain missing in Yosemite : Joel Thomazin (last seen 2021), Sandra Johnsen-Hughes (last seen 2020), and Peter Jackson (last seen 2016), according to NPS . Previously, a 2017 Freedom of Information request revealed that a total of 33 unsolved missing persons cases had been recorded in the history of Yosemite – though it is unclear what that figure is today. The Independent has pursued up-to-date statistics via an FOI.
